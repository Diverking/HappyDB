<p id="ppos"> However, I was not really in the mood to go anyway, so this gave me a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">valid</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">excuse</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> During dinnertime, I saw one of the girls I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark>, and we seemed to interact extremely well, so now I feel like thhere is some potential in that relationship!</p>
<p> I tried real butter for the first time.</p>

<p> That first sip of coffee that I had this morning.</p>
<p> I went to bed fairly early last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I needed the extra sleep and it made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel good</mark> this morning.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark> chocolate fudge brownie.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate some of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> meals( including bourbon steak) for dinner.</p>

<p> It reminded me of my childhood.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I made a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">green light</mark> on the way to work.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It was simple but made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very tasty</mark> luch at one of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> places.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excellent</mark> dinner.</p>
<p> I started watching South of Nowhere again after I got home from the coffe shop.</p>
<p> That show meant so much to me when I was younger.</p>
<p> I remember watching it alone and never talking about it because I did not want anyone to know I was watching a Lesbian themed show.</p>
<p> Yes I was in the closet, but more then that I could not accept to myself who I as.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Now that I do and people know i am gay, it makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to revisit that show that meant so much.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">had a great</mark> night of sleep after <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not sleeping well</mark> lately.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I'd still have been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> if the pizza did not have doughy crust, but really the doughy crust added to the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">hearty</mark> breakfast of bacon, eggs, biscuits, and hash browns which left me completely sated.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Eating a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark> dinner.</p>
<p id="pneg"> My answer going to sound <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">pathetic</mark> because I can not even remember what made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> or if I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smiling</mark> or not in the last 24 hours, I am <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">such a sad</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">rotten</mark> potato.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The closest i came to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> was several hours on Twitter one night with a group of women and we were just <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">being silly</mark>.</p>
<p> I listen old songs and it will led me to the old days memories.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Toady my birthday but I am <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not happy</mark> every year we are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">celebrating</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> but this I can <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not happy</mark>.</p>
<p> When I ate at a new restaurant.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> when I see the Warriors <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">win</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw a man eating potato.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I secretly gave a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">homeless</mark> man some money.</p>
<p> My girlfriend and I were walking around a park at night.</p>
<p> It was dark out and we were looking at a covered area that had a picnic table on it, considering bringing the kid down for a picnic the next day.</p>
<p id="pneg"> As we got closer, we noticed a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">homeless</mark> man was sleeping on the table.</p>
<p> He was in an old sleeping bag and had a few bags of his possessions around him.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We both decided to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">not disturb</mark> the old man and go somewhere else.</p>
<p id="pneg"> We got back in the car and I still did <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not feel okay</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw a pen and paper in my car so I wrote the guy a note: aHey there!</p>
<p> Hereas some cash for a hot cup of coffee and some breakfast tomorrow.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Hope you have a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> day today! a We <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">crept</mark> back over and I stealthily slid the note and cash under one of his bags.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Thereas <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">truly nothing happier</mark> than doing something for somebody else.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to church for St. Antony Novena and i felt spiritually <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Moving <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back home</mark> made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> this weekend when I had a quesadilla bun cheese burger with tots for din-din.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the office trip held at last week made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the each and every moment that we spend in our trip is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">unforgettable</mark>.</p>
<p> When I found leftover change in the pocket left forgotten for some time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to buy one of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> artist's new album that was just released.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> last night because I finally got to see a film that I have wanted to see for months and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">loved</mark> it.</p>
<p> The moment when I visit an old age home.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This is one of the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> moments in my life.</p>
<p id="ppos"> In Jan 2017 me and my job mates had been visited an old age home for the purpose of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">charity</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> past month one day i go to temple at the time one <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">poor</mark> old man very hungry, and i ask details i give food for the old man.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> while walking along the river yesterday because the river was so clear and full and running so fast over the rocks.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">loved</mark> it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have been attending archery classes and it gives me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">utter happiness</mark>.</p>
<p> Itas true that these two feelings are mutually exclusive, you just canat feel one way while feeling the other.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Thatas a big reason to lean towards being <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happier</mark> more of the time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It can be nearly impossible to go from <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">angry</mark> to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>, so you are just looking for the thought that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">eases</mark> you out of your <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">angry</mark> feeling and moves you in the direction of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It may take a while, but as long as you are headed in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">more positive</mark> direction youall be doing yourself a world of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark> thinking about going to Memphis, seeing Graceland and going to New Orleans on Friday for two weeks.</p>
<p> Some packages I ordered and forgot about arrived a few moments ago.</p>
<p> The date that I found out that we wi will be leaving to move to North Carolina.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> a steak dinner at a local restaurant.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The bakery had my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> pastry.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I discovered a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">lost</mark> photo album last week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Looking at the photos made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I am <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">homeless</mark> and had used up all the allowed nights in a certain shelter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to a different shelter and was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very relieved</mark> to learn they had a bed for me, and that after my first week for <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark>, I would not be turned away if I could not pay.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The streets are <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">very dangerous</mark> here so I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> to have a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">safe</mark> place to sleep.</p>
<p id="ppos"> learning and study make me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The day i went <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back home</mark> to stay after resigning on a night shift <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">tiring</mark> work i felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relieved</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> On tuesday I got a surprise <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">birthday present</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Going to the beach and watching a large flock of pelicans floating in the ocean nearby brought a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smile</mark> to my face.</p>
<p id="pneg"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> to be at the beach, and for several hours, not have to <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">worry at all</mark> about the mundane everyday things that sometimes can cause <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stress</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day, a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> escape.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One reason that experiences( and memories of those experiences) make us <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happier</mark> than material things is due to the entire cycle of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyment</mark> that experiences provide: planning the experience, looking forward to the experience, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the experience, and then remembering the experience.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Make your home a gallery of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">positive</mark> memories.</p>

<p> I saw Wendy.</p>
<p> She was still waiting me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> That things make me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There are many days in life that bring <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">joy</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasure</mark> but some days are the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> and remain in our mind forever.</p>
<p id="ppos"> These days are the reminders of the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazing</mark> time we have spent.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> day of my life is a visit to an orphanage.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> I felt that day is no match with any other day of my life.</p>

<p id="ppos"> An other event that happened this past month that made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark> was when i was going through the star bucks drive through, on my way to work and when i got to the window the driver in front had paid for my morning coffee.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">glad</mark> to have <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stuck</mark> to my diet today.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I went to the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">thrift</mark> store yesterday and that always makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> I always think of each night as a song.</p>
<p> Or each moment as a song.</p>
<p> But now I am seeing we do not live in a single song.</p>
<p> We move from song to song, from lyric to lyric, from chord to chord.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark> pingami movie song.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I see a special <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very funny</mark> animal video.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There are certain moments in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">popular</mark> culture that feel so right, where something happens in stories that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feels so good</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so appropriate</mark> in the story, that you can <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not help</mark> but be moved by it.</p>
<p> Usually when seeing a character taking a Woobie under his-her wings.</p>
<p> An acquaintance paid back $ 150 he owed me.</p>
<p> I did not really expect him to pay it back.</p>
<p> I went for a night drive alone.</p>
<p> I make chicken fry in my home and ate some pieces with spicy taste.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Something that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> was having a day off and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> time to myself without any work related things <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stressing</mark> me out.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Ah its <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so nice</mark> to have my life back again touche '.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When someone told me that I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> heart and that I was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">helpful</mark> person.</p>
<p> My package that I had been waiting on came in.</p>

<p id="ppos"> When I bought my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> caramel ice cream from the store.</p>
<p> while hearing music.</p>
<p> I have not had alcohol in a week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Buying a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really pretty</mark> new purse on clearance made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I got to go out to eat instead of having to cook dinner.</p>
<p> I always use a small purse which I carry while going shopping or anywhere outside.</p>
<p> My aunty had got me a purse which looks like a cake with icing on it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This was a real <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> one <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so handy</mark> to carry.</p>
<p> I am still using it even today and it does remind me of them every moment I take it with me.</p>

<p id="ppos"> In the past month, I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">had the opportunity</mark> to try a new, luxury restaurant that I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">had reservations</mark> for for 6 months, and that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I woke up everyday last month and was alive semi <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">healthy</mark> so it made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> and it continues to make me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to breath air and see another day life is too short and everyone is in a hurry and busy and life just keeps going by faster and faster then boom.</p>
<p id="pneg"> one day it is all over and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">frivolous</mark> little things like filling out this survey will all mean nothing it wi will be done and over with.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I also <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">figured out</mark> how to get a 3 day <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peace</mark> thing so <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">no one will attack</mark> me and I can just keep going without doing any of the fighting stuff.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Having <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather to grill out makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">incredibly happy</mark> when I got my order from Trades of Hope and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">not only loved</mark> the items that I purchased, but also found out that the bag I had bought purchased a chick that was given to a family in Africa.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had lots of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> food on a daily basis, particularly, there is shave ice and rice dishes, noddle dishes and other <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very good</mark> food.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Driving on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> stretch of highway on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautify</mark> spring day.</p>
<p> The road was not full of busy cars and trucks, and most of the drive was just incredible scenery.</p>
<p> Yesterday I was looking outside my house, some children playing cricket by looking them i was remembered my childhood days.</p>
<p> when i left work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Last month i have attended a comedy show, which was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very funny</mark> and i was laughing fully till the show was completed.</p>
<p id="ppos"> we <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> a lot.</p>
<p id="ppos"> every body was laughing and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the jokes by forgetting all their <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">worries</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> moment i can remember.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got really high last night and binge watched <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Love</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I laughed so much and just had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> alone time I have had in awhile.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I started practicing <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">mindful</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">meditation</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The first few days I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">really angry</mark>.</p>
<p> But now that I have learned how to do it right it is like sleep to me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calms</mark> me and makes me extremely Pleasant.</p>
<p> Considering I am an a * * *.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Other people around me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">appreciate</mark> it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The big event that happened this month that left me just <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beaming</mark> with <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">joy</mark>, was i did not expect anyone at my job to remember my birthday at all, i do not talk about it or <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really celebrate</mark> it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> So come lunch time i was drug out of my office and into the conference room where everyone was waiting with a cake and sang <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> birthday to me.</p>
<p> I went to Costco for the first time in a couple years.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I used to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">always enjoy</mark> going there several years ago and buying things in bulk and not having to shop for the rest of the month.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Finding ten dollars on the ground near the 7-11 convenience store on my way <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back home</mark> walking.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark> milk shake from a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">popular</mark> hotel.</p>
<p> I bought and ate some jelly beans for the store.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when the local radio station played one of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> old-school rap songs.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Eating at some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fancy</mark> buffet.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I taught a bible study class at my church and it went well, people were <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> with the content.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I met a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really attractive</mark> woman at a local bar.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Stepping foot on the MV Explorer for the first time was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">probably the happiest</mark> moment of my life.</p>
<p> I am not one to be overdramatic, but I really felt like my whole life had led up to that point.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Background: Three weeks into my sophomore year in college, I worked a study abroad fair and found out about this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">AMAZING</mark> program called Semester at Sea.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Basically you go on a cruise ship that was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">remodeled</mark> to be a floating university and study with world-renown professors as you travel around the world.</p>
<p> Four weeks into my second year in college, I had a stroke in my brainstem.</p>
<p> I remember finding the brochure for Semester at Sea and bawling my eyes out because everyone told me I'd never walk, let alone travel internationally again.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Fast forward a few years and I'd <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">recovered</mark> amazingly well from the stroke but now knew I have a genetic <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">disease</mark> which was making me <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">pretty sick</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I sign up for Semester at Sea because I can be <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">sick</mark> at home or be <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">sick</mark> traveling the world.</p>
<p> The later has better vistas.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I undergo experimental surgery which dramatically( although temporarily) <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">improves</mark> my symptoms, pack up my bags, and am ready to go.</p>
<p id="pneg"> As embarkation day got closer, I grew more and more <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">scared</mark> that something was going to prevent me from getting on that ship.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I was going to <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">injure</mark> myself or <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">get worse</mark> symptoms again or there was going to be a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bloody</mark> hurricane or something.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I had already tried to study abroad twice but <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">complications</mark> from surgery had prevented me both those times.</p>
<p> When I finally walked onto the ship, I realized that I had made it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was about to start <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">living my dream</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">against all odds</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> And oh man was it worth every bit of work and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">anxiety</mark> and hope I put into getting there.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">most meaningful</mark> experience of my life and it was even better because I felt like I had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">earned</mark> it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Definitely I tell you this is not my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favourite</mark> birthday oh god this moment I can not agree.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I get to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relax</mark> at home after work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Something that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> this month was getting a new insulated reusable bottle to hold hot or cold drinks.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I left skype.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fell</mark> down.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really good</mark> haircut done in last month which made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I moved into a new apartment and it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so wonderful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark> because the new apartment is so bright and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">clean</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> every day thus far.</p>
<p> Itas true that these two feelings are mutually exclusive, you just canat feel one way while feeling the other.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Thatas a big reason to lean towards being <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happier</mark> more of the time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It can be nearly impossible to go from <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">angry</mark> to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>, so you are just looking for the thought that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">eases</mark> you out of your <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">angry</mark> feeling and moves you in the direction of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It may take a while, but as long as you are headed in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">more positive</mark> direction youall be doing yourself a world of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> for the past month i have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">helped</mark> many <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">poor</mark> children.</p>

<p id="ppos"> We went to my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favourite</mark> restaurant at the end of the street and went to all the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazing</mark> rides.</p>

<p> Yesterday we prepared biriyani like Chinese hotel.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One event in the past 24 hours that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> was that I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> schedule for my Saturday and got to sleep in until later in the morning than I normally sleep.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I do not have any big <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> events, just low level, stuff that probably means something only to me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I do not often <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel excitement either good</mark> or bed.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today I felt a tiny bit of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excitement</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a previous version of this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">hit</mark> a day or 2 ago.</p>
<p> In that version, one event was that I * finally * ordered my new server( computer).</p>
<p> Today the case arrived.</p>
<p> I was about to go downstairs for lunch when I saw the mailman pull up.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Even though the case is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">useless</mark> to me without all the other components, it made the fact that I finally ordered the new system, something I put off for the past year or 2, a reality.</p>
<p> Like I said, it is a small thing that only matters to me.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Thhere is always a moment when you start to fall out of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark>, whether it is with a person or an idea or a cause, even if it is one you only narrate to yourself years after the event: a tiny thing, a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">wrong</mark> word, a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">false</mark> note, which means that things can never be quite the same again.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I made an incredible meat <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> stir fry last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really delicious</mark>.</p>
<p> I put tempeh in it, which I had never used.</p>
<p> It has more texture then tofu, which is too mushy for my palate.</p>
<p> Open the newly delivered amazon package.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I woke up I went to the bathroom and I took a big poop, it made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel great</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It might not be very large, but I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to know I would be getting something.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One event that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> in the past 24 hours, is witnessing a fireworks show from my balcony.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sight of the fireworks caused me to feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">appreciation</mark> for living in the city I am currently in.</p>
<p> today morning our city has jallikattu( bull fight) festival.</p>

<p> I saw many students on the school campus.</p>
<p> Some were playing and some were talking to each other.</p>
<p> But I did not know any one.</p>

<p id="ppos"> What's <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">funny</mark> is that I was not even watching the first airing on TV because I had an early class in the morning.</p>

<p id="ppos"> But <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">luckily</mark> as I was leave the elevator to my floor where I work I looked down and found twenty bucks on the floor and no one was around, so I took it.</p>
<p> I slept in because I did not have meetings in the morning.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day out so I went on the balcony and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxed</mark> with a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> book.</p>
<p> Food at work is usually not very good, but today it was above average.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was better enough that it made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>

<p> Arriving home today from visiting friends in Tennessee.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Not that I do <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not love</mark> them <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very dearly</mark>; but Greyhound bus Terminals and the Buses themselves could give Hell a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">run for its money</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I can not even begin to describe <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">how uncomfortable</mark> the seats are, and that is even when not having anyone sit beside you.</p>
<p> And the 12 hour lay over in Nashville trying to sleep on metal seats to pass the time.</p>
<p id="pneg"> But <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">worst</mark> of all was my initial bus was late which made me miss my connection to Knoxville hence why had a 12 hour layover in Nashville.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Not to mention they did not even try to make <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> in any fashion.</p>
<p id="pneg"> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">Hell</mark> a food voucher so I could eat during these 12 hours would at least have been something!</p>
<p> So Getting home probably made my week more than you could understand.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">So vey happy</mark> to walk through that door!!!</p>

<p id="ppos"> Of course I was too young to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">help</mark>, so she would have a UT football game on the radio to keep me entertained.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I did <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not understand</mark> the game, but I knew who John Ward was.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a warm-chilly feeling, sitting on the couch all <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cozy</mark>, but being <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">interrupted</mark> by the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> breezes wafting in from every corner of the living room.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I had an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazing</mark> audition to sing the national anthem at a major league baseball game.</p>

<p id="pneg"> I had made a remark to a convenience store clerk about why people want to continue living in <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">such difficult times</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> To my surprise, she gave an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">insightful</mark> answer:" You get to feel."</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">simplicity</mark> of her answer was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">inspiring</mark>, and I said," That was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> answer!"</p>

<p id="ppos"> I made a trip to the spiritual and holistic place, Masaniamman Temple and did <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">meditation</mark> in the temple.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">such a happy</mark> moment that could not be described in words.</p>

<p id="ppos"> That Diary makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> at the moment.</p>
<p> I found $ 20.</p>
<p> 00 on the street.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I think this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was a great</mark> moment because I was having a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bummer</mark> of a day and then on an empty street $ 20.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There was nowhere and no one to return the money to, so I picked it up and bought a coffee that I otherwise could not have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">afforded</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Lucky</mark> day.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The first and most fundamental responsibility for a human being is to become a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">joyous</mark> being.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I gave myself a special <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gift</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to get a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really good</mark> salad today at work for lunch.</p>
<p> I was excited that I placed a big bet on UNC and they wont March Madness.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate at my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> fast-food restaurant.</p>
<p id="pneg"> My <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> moment in these last months, it was definitely the personal encounter with God, and having many times thinking about a specific issue, thinking, dreaming, analyzing and reliving moments to have a certain response in life after a long state of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">depression</mark> And <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">anxiety</mark>, caused by several events.</p>
<p id="pneg"> It was very good to go through a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">difficult situation</mark> to understand several important aspects that I did <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not understand</mark> before and would not have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">understood</mark> without having gone through a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">great pain</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> After this I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel better</mark>.</p>
<p> My birthday.</p>

<p> The day I thought that I had found someone who I could spend the rest of my life with.</p>
<p> Eating chocolates during lectures, sitting in last benches in class.</p>
<p> I ate some ice cream.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It has been my observation that the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> of people, the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">vibrant</mark> doers of the world, are almost always those who are using- who are putting into play, calling upon, depending upon-the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">greatest</mark> number of their <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">God-given</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">talents</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">capabilities</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I jumped into the hot tub after work to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relax</mark>.</p>
<p> Grilling a piece of chicken on my barbeque grill three days ago.</p>
<p> One day, I was waiting to board a plane for an 8 hour trip to Orlando.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The person that was going to be assigned next to me was over 500 lbs and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">smelly</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Well, he <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">dropped dead</mark> of a heart <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">attack</mark> prior to boarding.</p>
<p> I got a seat with an empty spot next to me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxing</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Let me tell you about another thing that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> well it was 420 this week so everybody was showing there <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> and support for bud so that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> for sure.</p>
<p id="ppos"> On the second <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">home game</mark> of the season the Cubs had their ring ceremony and I have not known a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happier</mark> moment in my life.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> three weeks ago when my surgeon pulled out the drainage compartment that I had in my abdomen and I was finally done with having to <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fuck</mark> around with doctors, that <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">shit</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stings</mark> like <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">hell</mark> by the way, there is a tiny hole it comes out of but man you can feel it, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">glad</mark> to be done with that <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">mess</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> my work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">celebrated</mark> my birthday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really good</mark> double scoop ice cream cone after I had been craving one for month.</p>
<p> I got my hands on Nintendo Switch on day 2 after waiting for several hours in front of Target.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate some donuts which was quiet <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> as it was a flavor I have never tasted before.</p>
<p> We got to see Steve Martin and Martin Short perform live at a show.</p>
<p> I shared a recipe of mine on YouTube a few months back.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I filmed myself making a dish that I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really enjoy</mark> and oddly enough, by sharing it with other people and maybe teaching them how to make it too; it makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> everytime I see that I get more views on the video because it means maybe I am teaching my recipe to someone.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I think it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really cool</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Earlier today I got a new pack of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Juicy</mark> Fruit Gum, which is my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> type of gum.</p>
<p id="ppos"> At work I had a customer tell me that my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smile</mark> was very welcoming and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> give my old magazines to people on vacation.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> provide them with some entertainment when the weather was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not so well</mark> on the beach.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i will get into the habit of dreaming big are more likely to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">accomplish</mark> their goals than those who do not.</p>
<p id="ppos"> If you dare to dream big, your mind will put itself in a focused and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">positive</mark> state.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I threw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">successful</mark> party and everyone had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful time</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> coffee at Philz.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to have a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark> meal after I was really hungry after a long day at work.</p>
<p> Sunday church service, it was very uplifting.</p>
<p> I was in the drive though line at Starbucks and when I pulled up to the window to pay for my drink the cashier told me the lady in front of me already paid for me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I decided to pay it forward and pay for the car behind me which <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was a great</mark> feeling!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went out for a party after four long years and had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">a lot of fun</mark> and it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt really good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The next event that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> was going to France!</p>
<p> It was a long time coming and I finally got around to doing it.</p>
<p> I was off work on Monday after Easter.</p>
<p> This gave me a four day weekend.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt great</mark> to be off work for four days.</p>
<p> the day I found out how to sell music online.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Getting a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> grade in microbiology.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have not had time to study with work but I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt good</mark> knowing I could at least regurgitate information from a lecture.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> after an inital <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">shock</mark> of finding out that I am expecting for the fourth time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> because I have all boys and it gave me hope of having a little girl a dream I have had my whole life as I have thought that what I should have been having the whole time even thought I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> my boys more than anything.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I got biopsy results back that I was convinced would be <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bad</mark>.</p>
<p> They were not.</p>
<p> another small but weird one- a package that I was waiting for, arrived.</p>
<p> It was some mixed emotions because I tracked it online and it says it was delivered, but I did not see it by the mailboxes or in front of my door.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">kind of freaked out</mark> because I thought it got <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stolen</mark>, but it was placed in a package locker that I have in my building.</p>
<p id="ppos"> So, I was doubly <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">thrilled</mark> that it arrived as I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">anticipating</mark> it, AND it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">not stolen</mark>.</p>
<p> I often go to old age home and i spent time with them.</p>
<p> I provide food and clothes for them.</p>
<p id="ppos"> They feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate a a burger at the place considered to have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> burger in Chicago for the first time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Coming home and finding 2 bunnies eating in the garden was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">joyous</mark> moment.</p>
<p> I went on a week long Caribbean vacation.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a cheese pastry yesterday for <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> at Panera.</p>
<p> I went to a baseball game with my spouse, we sat up in the bar and drank beers and chit chatted about the game.</p>
<p id="pneg"> the sun was out the air smelled like <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">junk food</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> People all around were laughing and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">having a good time</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">It was great</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Being able to have my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> meal for breakfast recently which is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> for me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One of my lizards stopped eating as soon as I left town, but a week before I came <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back home</mark> she started eating again.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> knowing that my pets are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">healthy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I tasted a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark> chocolate bar.</p>
<p> I switched jobs to a new store, it is awesome and I like everybody.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Once you accept the fact that life is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not fair</mark>, you wi will be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">more at peace</mark> with yourself.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Instead of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">obsessing</mark> over <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">how unfair</mark> life is, just focus on what you can control and change it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">for the better</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> With today's politicians, bankers, lawyers and public service executives, it is hardly surprising that <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">old farts</mark> like me and my wife( that is a novelty today) resort to remembering old times to grasp at <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> memories and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel better</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> getting off from work on a Friday evening and being able to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> my weekend.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> last week when the clothes i ordered online fit me perfectly.</p>
<p> being able to fly in an airplane.</p>
<p> I do not frequently travel and it is commonly done by car.</p>

<p> This week I stumbled upon the secret hiding place that my chickens had been laying their eggs.</p>
<p> There was over a dozen eggs there and it made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p id="pneg"> One of my students brought me coffee at school, without knowing that I was almost through my grocery budget and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">could not afford</mark> to go get coffee.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Last night, I ate my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> dish, risotto with artichokes at the restaurant near my house.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I can think of a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark> surprise to share yesterday my last event.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am going to tell something what it was, where it happened and when, and then explain exactly why the unexpected happening made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark> lest event, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">I really like</mark> last event in my life.</p>
<p> The second event was simply using a rental car from work.</p>
<p> I usually am always someone who is very conscious about my money and that plays a large part on my traveling.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> getting out and driving, by with more responsibilities now those moments are incredibly limited.</p>
<p id="ppos"> So when I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> mini van that I could use at my leisure, I spent an hour just driving.</p>
<p id="ppos"> No where in particular to go, but simply <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the sensation of traveling.</p>
<p> The moment was made even more special by the satellite radio.</p>
<p id="ppos"> During this drive, I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> listen to music I grew up with and simply just <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> being alive in that moment.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I marched for science with a lot of people in DC.</p>
<p> Every time I came home and had complete solitude.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">despise</mark> being around people, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasant</mark> or not.</p>
<p> Human beings are lower than pigs to me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> occurred yesterday when my neighbor brought over some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> tuna he had caught the night before.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I do not get to eat fish that often, and to have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">such beautiful</mark> meat that was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> was a real treat.</p>

<p> Coming to work to an empty office.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My manager( <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark> woman) and 2 other workers in the office were away.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">volunteer</mark> for a Wildlife Safari Park( one of the parks where you can drive through and see <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> big animals).</p>
<p> I have been monitoring the bluebird boxes throughout the park to find hatchlings or eggs.</p>
<p> A few weeks ago was the first time I reached into the nest and touched an egg.</p>

<p> I visited a travelling art exhibit on Italian sculpture.</p>
<p id="pneg"> My Australian Rules Football team( St Kilda) winning a game that people said they would <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">lose</mark> and my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> player coming back from <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">injury</mark> and kicking a few goals.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> get a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> nap on the subway ride home.</p>

<p id="ppos"> i took my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> dinner.</p>
<p> There being no line for the drive through at Taco Bell.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excitement</mark> of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">anticipating</mark> a trip is almost as incredible as the trip itself.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">proven</mark> that planning a vacation increases our levels of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sun, the beach and the palm trees are just a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">welcome</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bonus</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ate a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> meal.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Getting out of work early made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> I went on a cruise.</p>
<p> All I did there was eat, sleep and play.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I did not have to <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">worry about</mark> anything else.</p>
<p id="ppos"> last week we <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">celebrated</mark> farewell party in our master degree completion.</p>
<p> our college junior were arranged the party.</p>
<p id="ppos"> it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really funny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> function.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I got to eat at my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> resturant.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ordered a familiar dish from a familiar restaurant, but it was unusually <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I try to watch what I eat but I had a Snickers this afternoon that was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> That definitely made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">found a great</mark> restaurant to eat at in Minneapolis.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> bowl of ice cream.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Favorite</mark> hockey team made the playoffs.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I got a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">discount</mark> on a meal at one of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> restaurants.</p>
<p> When I was really young back in the 80as and 90as and you wanted to learn about something then you had to ask someone who may have had spotty knowledge.</p>
<p> Or you had to visit the local library and maybe there was a book or magazine about it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Things are so different now and even though it is just a part of everyday life it still <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazing</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This is a little one, but drinking a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> glass of homemade iced coffee, <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">burning</mark> sandalwood <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">incense</mark>, and folding clothes while watching Netflix by myself one afternoon was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">content</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxed</mark>.</p>
<p> When I treat myself to a drink from Sharetea.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">helps</mark> my day go by <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smoother</mark>.</p>
<p> Human life is the collection of some important events.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Of those events, some events are forgotten but some other events are so important and heart touching that can not be forgotten and remain <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> in the mind.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My first day school is one of those events which will remain ever <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> in my heart.</p>
<p> I was then 6 years old.</p>
<p> One day my mother told me that I was going to start my school the next day.</p>
<p> I was very excited.</p>
<p> I could not think of anything else.</p>
<p> I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, and the students of the school.</p>
<p> I could not even sleep at night.</p>
<p> The next morning my mother woke me up early in the morning.</p>
<p> I had a bath and put on my best clothes.</p>
<p> Having breakfast we started walking towards the school.</p>
<p> After half an hour we reached the school.</p>
<p> I saw many students on the school campus.</p>
<p> Some were playing and some were talking to each other.</p>
<p> But I did not know any one.</p>
<p id="pneg"> So, I got little <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">nervous</mark>.</p>
<p> My mother took me to the headmaster's room.</p>
<p> He asked me some questions.</p>
<p id="ppos"> As I could answer them all, he became <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleased</mark>.</p>
<p> He called in a teacher and send me to my class with her.</p>
<p> I was admitted to class one.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The class teacher and the student receive me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">heartily</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Though I was little <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">nervous</mark>, soon I became <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">easy</mark>.</p>
<p> I will remember the day as long as I live.</p>
<p> I got to go on a walk before work and listen to audiobooks.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really yummy</mark> burger for lunch.</p>
<p> It was homemade and had onions and tomatoes.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It also had two different types of cheese, and it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">complemented</mark> it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very well</mark>.</p>
<p> Finally eating dinner after going the whole day without eating.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Enjoying</mark> the quiet in my apartment building while my downstairs neighbors are gone for the week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gifted</mark> a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> pizza.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I drank some wine and went to see The <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fate</mark> of the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">furious</mark> on Tuesday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I shaved this morning and again right now and it makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel good</mark> to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">clean</mark>.</p>
<p> today I found a 5 dollar bill on the ground at the grocery store.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I started letting go of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">hurt feelings</mark> that were dragging me down into <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">despair</mark>.</p>
<p> I can focus on things that actually matter to me.</p>
<p> Four days ago I took a week off from work and I do not have to think about my job for the next three days.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i played hockey <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very well</mark> about a month with my school mates that movement was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that tomorrow is a thursday, because I am going <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back home</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There was an unusual gathering of a half dozen people in the same strange( if unfortunate) <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">predicament</mark> and through it I got to network with some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">interesting</mark> people.</p>
<p> I finally found a new chocolate bar that I'd been craving since I saw it advertised was released at my store so I could buy it.</p>
<p> When your online purchase finally arrives at your house.</p>
<p> When someone wants to take a picture with you.</p>
<p> When your dentist tells you you do not have any cavities.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i heard a new song on the radio that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">i really liked</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have not heard a new song on the radio that i <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">liked</mark> in almost a year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> today that I cooked and ate a homemade Chicago style deep fried pizza puff from home.</p>
<p> Your attention naturally flows in the direction of whatever you hold as important.</p>
<p id="ppos"> If your thought and your emotion is important, naturally your whole attention wi will <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">be right</mark> there.</p>
<p> But that is a psychological reality.</p>
<p> That has nothing to do with the existential.</p>
<p id="pneg"> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">Suffering</mark> is not showered upon us, it is manufactured.</p>
<p> And the manufacturing unit is in your mind.</p>
<p> It is time to shut down the manufacturing unit.</p>
<p id="ppos"> While reading the newspaper today, I came across a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fascinating</mark> story of a village named Khonoma( Nagaland) and how their fierce hunter-warriors laid down arms to save the environment.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It gave me immense <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">😃</mark>.</p>
<p> Ate some of my Easter chocolate.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i attended one function with orphanage people and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> moment.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I can not remember any other <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">unique</mark> event that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> in the past 3 months, all that comes to mind are brief reoccurring moments of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> that I did experience during that time period, like being outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the nature, eating food, etc.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that i did not owe anything to the irs.</p>
<p> Waking up early and hearing the birds in the morning.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> because I feel so well within myself despite the fact I have not been taking enough <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">care of</mark> my body.</p>

<p> We( humans) have made this world to live, money to spend and buy food for ourselves.</p>
<p> How about these animals how will they ask.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very very happy</mark> feeding animals and the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">unconditional</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> they share.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One thing that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> was when the deli worker at publix gave me a slice of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sweet</mark> munster to try, it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark>.</p>
<p> Going back to school.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> about one of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> restaurant giving away a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> menu item.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I bought air conditioner in my home for this summer season and that moment makes me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The thought of looking forward to a new restaurant that I am going to made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> today, because I typically visit the same types of restaurants and eat the same things, whereas this restaurant wi will be a new experience to me in a number of ways.</p>
<p> Not having to go to a wedding that I initially said I would go to.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I bought one of those <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark>, Dyson blade-less fans, and I got to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> it on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> day in April.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really good</mark> home cooked meal.</p>

<p> I went to the museum to see an exhibit about spiders.</p>
<p> On the way to the museum I stopped to get a coffee.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The person in front of me in line ended up paying for my coffee without telling me as a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> gesture.</p>

<p> Arbys came out with the pork belly sandwich again.</p>
<p> I saw a movie for the first time that just made me change the way I thought of things.</p>
<p> I heard a new song on the radio that somehow felt very familiar.</p>
<p> After several attempts to discover what the song was using google, I found it is a new version of a piano duet called" Heart and Soul."</p>
<p> I played various videos of the duet as well as the official song video.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">totally delighted</mark> me, on several levels-- it made me nostalgic for times as a teen that people played around with the duet; it is a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> tune itself; and it made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to know others are learning it for the first time as the new version.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Two weeks ago I went to a plasma do notion center, I used to do note blood every 4 months as I have O- blood and I am a" universal donor ' I stopped due to school and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stress</mark> and recently wanted to start doing so again.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I chose plasma do notion as it allows me to do note more often and they pay you which was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pretty nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> When i got to the center I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">a bit nervous</mark>, and the process to register there was kind of long, but the staff was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and had movies playing while I do noted so i was distracted from the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">uncomfortable</mark> needle.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt good</mark> do noting again knowing that what I did could potentially help save someone.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> when Iam <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> It really does change everything.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I shall always keep them, and it will make me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> to think that you found them, on that far away island, from which Columbus sailed to discover our <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">dear</mark> country.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Large portions of my class members have called or gone to their folks and told... You will likely <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> yourself, to recapture your <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">significant serenity</mark>, and to get on with...</p>
<p id="ppos"> The third individual you should <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pardon</mark> is every other person in your life who has ever... At whatever point I think about that 2 weeks ago occasion event or circumstance I feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so upbeat</mark>, simply rehash," I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pardon</mark> myself totally.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Few days ago I went to australia to visit important place and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really i enjoyed</mark> that moment.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The University of North Carolina <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">won</mark> the national championship in men's basketball.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I went to the game this year and was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">thrilled</mark> when they <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">won</mark> the game.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I look back at pictures from the games now and still <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smile</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Seeing the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It may sound too <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> to be true, but once you have seen the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> people in your life who have nothing, you really start rethinking what the world, and society, tells us that we need to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Concentration is one of the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> things in my life.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I got back to my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> pastime, running.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">most fascinating</mark> discoveries about myself so far this year, is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">how happy</mark> it makes me to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">help</mark> others.</p>
<p id="ppos"> For some time I had been consistently meeting founders to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">help</mark> them with their <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">startups</mark> without realising that it was making me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Then when I read <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Happiness</mark>: A Guide to Developing Lifeas Most Important Skill by Matthieu Ricard I connected the dots of when I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> and the activity I was doing: <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">helping</mark> others.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The reason this made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so jubilant</mark> is that I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">apprehensive</mark> that she would have quandaries during the birthing process, but since I slumbered through the entire thing I experienced <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">no worries</mark>.</p>

<p> I happen to have a small interest in hummingbirds, and living in the old-town area of pocatello, Idaho like i do, people tend not to see many of them.</p>
<p> I was curious one evening last month and found a site on the little birds.</p>
<p> One had been spotted just a few streets away which never really happens.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Although I have been wishing we would have some at the apartments I live in, it also made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> in that they might be fun to look for this summer.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> xm radio for the next week or so.</p>
<p> last week i visited the jute cottage in banglore and i purchased many jute purses and jute bags from there.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that my meeting last week got cancelled.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I found <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">a plus</mark> 16 fire <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">protection</mark> ring on an online MMORPG game that my husband and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> playing.</p>
<p> That ring is a rare thing to discover.</p>
<p> In fact, before I found it I did not know that such a thing existed.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Additionally, I did not find it while <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">killing</mark> a boss or exploring a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">dangerous</mark> place in the game.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Instead, I found it doing some routine farming among <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">easier</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">mobs</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> every time I log back into the game and see it sitting in my inventory box.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today, I had my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favourite</mark> cold drink with <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">my crush</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I tried to make Belgian waffles for breakfast on Sunday morning for the first time ever, and they were <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Now that summer is here and the days are getting warmer again: I am making a small roof in the backyard, grabbing an ice cold beer and just <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relax</mark> after a hard day of construction work.</p>

<p id="ppos"> There are many( most) <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> moments in our lives...</p>
<p> But i would like to add this one during my travel.</p>
<p> Around 2 months back, i visited Rishikesh and stayed in camps near Ganga.</p>
<p> At night time, it was dark as there was no electricity in camps.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Suddenly i saw that in opposite side of camps, there were hundreds of fireflies <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lighting up</mark> the area.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">mesmerizing</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I got a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark> meal yesterday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Do you seek moments in life to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>?</p>
<p> We all do.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We all are finding the reasons to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">celebrate</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Some of us find <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> while watching TV after a day off.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Some of us have weekend plans to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> However, with the time we are forgetting <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> in daily life.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We are scheduling our <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> on certain conditions.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Until we catch a big event or <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">achievement</mark>, we keep waiting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark>.</p>
<p> We just let time pass until then.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Therefore, we all live waiting for some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> moments in life.</p>
<p> We forget that there could be life in each moment.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Having after work wine at home and talking all night made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> dream.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I was told by a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very beautiful</mark> woman that I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">handsome</mark>.</p>
<p> I was given some extra food today as I went to get my food through the drive through at a fast food restaurant.</p>

<p> I ate it in front of the TV, watching the basketball game.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The basketball game was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not very competitive</mark>, but the pizza and ranch were <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very good</mark>.</p>
<p> I shared some of the marinara sauce with my cat.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">getting better</mark> from a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bad</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">sickness</mark>.</p>

<p> Then, I dipped the cookies in some coffee which was even better.</p>
<p> Getting rid of old stuff I do not use.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My packed lunch was actually <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">tasty</mark>!</p>
<p id="ppos"> My work shift was very slow in regards to kitchen preparation, and thus I had little work to do, allowing me to operate stress-free and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">earn</mark> money while doing so.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">ridiculous</mark> in an age when anyone can hear whatever they want on demand, but I guess I was hoping someone else, somewhere, would discover it for the first time and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> it as much as I did.</p>
<p> Smelling my morning coffee when I first woke up.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a really great breakfast that came out <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">tasting</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">delicious</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The pizza guy <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">messed up</mark> my order and so they gave me my order for <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark>!</p>
