<p id="ppos"> The day I returned to the gym after surgery was an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">AMAZING</mark> day!</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Fitness</mark> is a huge part of my life, so being away for months was a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">horrible</mark> experience!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I became <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I lifted a new personal best at the gym for deadlifts.</p>
<p> that weight in the gym is increasing.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">strength</mark> is increasing due to the fact that I am doing more push ups at night.</p>
<p> I feel like I am getting stronger.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to a long yoga class taught by a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> teacher.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> the day I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> walk 1 mile on my treadmill.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Finishing a long yoga session made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark> last week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> workout and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lose 20 pounds</mark>.</p>
<p> I ran 12 miles.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got a membership at a new gym, which I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really love</mark>.</p>
<p> I have been running for exercise the last few months.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> run an 8 minute mile for the first time.</p>
<p> Going for a run near the beach.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go to the gym and do my normal workout routine after a year off for surgery.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today, I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> gym session after work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> workout legs for the first time in a while today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Exercise has such a profound effect on our <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">well-being</mark> that itas actually been proven to be an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">effective</mark> strategy for <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">overcoming depression</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> In a study cited in Shawn Achoras book, The Happiness Advantage 1, three groups of patients treated their <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">depression</mark> with either medication, exercise, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p> The results of this study really surprised me.</p>
<p> I ran the fastest 5k that I have ever run.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have been exercising more and that has made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> I set a new PR at the gym.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Keeping physically fit by running and lifting weights keeps me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> and active.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I started consistently exercising which has made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel better</mark> physically and mentally.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ran a 5 mile race in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good time</mark> and finished in the top 5.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My run( which was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">overdue</mark>) <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt so good</mark> yesterday that I ran an extra mile.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> morning filled with a great workout and prayer session.</p>
<p> While out for a run, I ran into a girl that showed interest in me.</p>
<p> Running 3 miles in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have been <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">rather out of shape</mark> for the last 15 years and since last summer I have been exercising more and getting back <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">in shape</mark>.</p>
<p> I have not ran a sub 30 5k since probably around 2000.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Therefore, when I got 3 miles in under 30 minutes that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was a great</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> run a 7:30 mile for three miles after not running as frequently as I felt I should have been.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I completed a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">really difficult</mark> workout that I was not sure I could even do.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I ran 10 miles on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> day and this was the longest I have run since my last <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">injury</mark> and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt amazing</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">on the run</mark>.</p>
