<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark> for the first time in a long time and I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">loving it</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The rain stopped and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> sunlight appeared so I went for a walk and took some photographs.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">very sultry</mark> in our place, our AC unit was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">damaged</mark> by rodents.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The Electrician came earlier today and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">repaired</mark> it.</p>
<p> Thank God, I need not sweat today.</p>
<p> in my garden i planted a rose plant last month.</p>
<p id="ppos"> yesterday morning a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">colorful</mark> rose <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">flourished</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> it made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The offsite with colleagues <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was great fun</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> watching the sunset on the porch.</p>
<p> Sunset is the time when the sun goes down and night begins.</p>
<p id="ppos"> During the sunset, nature assumes <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark>, bright, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">charming</mark>.</p>
<p> The sun seems to be a disc of gold.</p>
<p id="ppos"> At the time of sunset, one can <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">serenity</mark> of a sunset.</p>
<p> Then nature seems in a hurry.</p>
<p> People finish their work and return home.</p>
<p> Birds return to their nests.</p>
<p> The cowboys become busy with returning home with cattle.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When the sun sets, nature looks <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p> Then the nature starts getting dark.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The slight darkness of the sunset creates a feeling of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">joy</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">tranquility</mark> in us.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beauty</mark> of the sunset <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">helps</mark> a poet to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">generate</mark> any ideas and compose poems.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One last azalea <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> came out today and I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see it because all of the other flowers were <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">killed</mark> by a late frost a few weeks back.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I was driving home to my house and saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very beautiful</mark> sunset.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Sitting outside drinking a cup of tea in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> surrounded by my recently <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloomed</mark> tulips.</p>
<p> It was drizzling in the morning when I went for a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> such a weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is starting to warm up which I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">super happy</mark> about.</p>
<p> I got wet by a spring rain.</p>
<p> I went for a run in the neighborhood.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Walking the first morning light with the dog when the sun was just <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">creeping</mark> behind the rushes and the birds were in full song.</p>
<p id="ppos"> it rained today and made the surroundings <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk early in the morning and air was clear and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">crisp</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I sat outside in my backyard and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the greenery and the sun that shone down on my face.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> weather outside makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I visited a new park in the area and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had been out to a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> garden.</p>
<p> I went on a short day hike at the wilderness park.</p>
<p> Yesterday I found and bought a Persimmon tree at Home Depot.</p>
<p> Later on I planted the tree in front of our yard.</p>
<p id="ppos"> That the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and planted the first vegetables of the season.</p>
<p id="ppos"> They should grow in this weather <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nicely</mark>.</p>
<p> There is a nest of birds in my horse's stall.</p>
<p> It is up on a beam.</p>
<p> I have been watching the mother bird build it for awhile.</p>
<p> When I went into the stall today, I saw and could hear the baby birds chirping.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see that they all hatched.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I worked on my garden in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The plants were all growing <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so nicely</mark> and the air was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so clean</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooperated</mark> and it was not a cold morning!</p>
<p> I rode my bike to a cafe.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">improved</mark> majorly and a light wind was blowing in my direction.</p>
<p> I went for a run on a nature trail near my house.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This is the beginning of spring, so it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> to see the forest coming <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back to life</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk, it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk this morning the smell of morning air was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> and the weather <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was great</mark>.</p>
<p> I went for a run on my local riverside trail last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The springtime weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">refreshing</mark>.</p>
<p> Some vegetables that I had planted had sprouted and I saw green poking through the soil this morning.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sun was out and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>.</p>
<p> I stepped outside without a jacket today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun is shining</mark> and it finally feels a bit like spring!</p>
<p> The sun finally coming out after days of rain.</p>
<p> I picked up running again now that the winter weather has finally died down.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel much better</mark> physically and emotionally because of it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going for a long cycling ride and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> today's <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasant</mark> yesterday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day but not too hot due to the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> breeze we had that day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a long walk with my dog this morning in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> Spring weather.</p>
<p> I saw a huge toad or frog in my backyard.</p>
<p> It started raining after having such hot weather for a while.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">soothing</mark>.</p>
<p> We are supposed to get a foot or two of snow tonight and we could really use it, very dry here.</p>
<p> I sat outside and listened to the birds.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> sunset with double rainbows.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was lying in bed listening to the sounds of the city around me on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a walk through the park and it made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> yesterday and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyable</mark> to be outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a run in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Hearing the sounds of nature around me made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Playing with the dog in the yard- the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> yesterday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was great</mark> outside.</p>
<p> It rained really hard today while I worked from home indoors.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cozy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I looked at the forcast for this weekend and the weather is going to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw dinner in my yard.</p>
<p> There were 6 in the yard and laying on the grass like dogs do when they curl up on a carpet.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The scene was quiet and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">serene</mark>.</p>
<p> Walking outside to the grocery store.</p>
<p> It was raining a little but the temperature was very mild and it really felt like spring.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And then I saw that the magnolia a few doors down the street is about to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>!</p>
<p> I woke up to a foot of snow and it was not in the forecast.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It looks so pretty outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so tranquil</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> On my walk back from the post office this afternoon, I stopped under my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> magnolia tree and soaked in her <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beauty</mark> as she starts to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Sitting outside in the sun made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today there was a thunderstorm, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> thunderstorms, especially when I do not have to drive in them!</p>
<p id="ppos"> The day was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and I went for a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sky was bright blue and there was a light <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> breeze moving the tree branches and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">touching</mark> my face.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Taking a walk around the neighborhood made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> watching the sunset from my apartment.</p>
<p> I live near the sea and I often watch the sunset over the ocean from my apartment.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today was the first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day after four days of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> being outside today as it was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> warmer day with no rain.</p>
<p id="pneg"> It had been raining all morning and I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">worried</mark> I would have to walk my friend's dog in the rain, but the sun came out when I got to his house.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It rained overnight and stepping out to my car in the morning <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt great</mark> with the water still in the air.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The smell of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> rain is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">unique</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Both of my dogs and my toddler played together <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nicely</mark> outside while I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The temperature today was 70 degrees and the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun was shining</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">do not like</mark> cold weather so this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was heaven</mark> for me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Hiking 7 miles at Norvin Green State Forest made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> this month.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>, and I went running for the first time in several months.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was 70 degrees out the other day, and it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt amazing</mark> to go for a walk in the park.</p>

<p> The leaves in the jungle are large and can be used to collect rain water to drink.</p>
<p> the jungle is such an abundant resource of plants and animals, the resources for finding food are everywhere.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is just a matter to find food... after the day end... it was a night i was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">dying</mark> from a mosquito bite its very iching i con, t sleep <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">properly</mark>... but i saw the animels in live that was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really amazing</mark> it was just my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">dreams come true</mark>... after coming back from jungle i felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relax</mark> my friends and family was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very proud</mark> of me it <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fell</mark> me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> at <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunrise</mark> i woke up and walked into the woods.</p>
<p id="ppos"> and seeing the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunrise</mark> over the lake sitting there on that rock was the most beutifull peacefull moment of my life.</p>
<p id="ppos"> this is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">one of the best</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">memorable</mark> in my entire line till date.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice enough</mark> to go outside for a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> In the past month, it snowed here and, if thhere is one thing I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> about the Winter, it is the snow.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Being outside in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cloudless</mark> blue sky day and feeling the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> breeze on my face.</p>

<p> I got a salry hike.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has been weird here in Michigan this Winter and we needed to sell our motor home and the weather <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">cracked</mark> and we had some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> days that were not supposed to be here.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">SO HAPPY</mark> to sell our motor home during this time of unseasonal <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmth</mark>!</p>
<p id="ppos"> We <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">were able to</mark> show it to a bunch of people and this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> young couple came and looked at it and bought it the next day.</p>
<p> I went camping.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Literally, stopping to smell a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> rose while walking my dogs.</p>
<p> The Red- Winged black birds are back at the bird feeders!</p>
<p> A sure sign of spring!</p>
<p> I planted a spring vegetable garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i went zoo to realize how they really feel in the cage but they have to live in jungle not in zoo... it was the nature i saw in jungle it was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">so bad</mark> to see the animals in the zoo... must go and see the animals in jungle that wi will be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazed</mark> then i feel my jungle trip which was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> i was feeling like something special... it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very good</mark> to see the animals in jungle if you want to really see them all must go and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> as i did.</p>
<p> I planted some plants in my garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My plants were grown in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">healthy</mark> way with flowers.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am so <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excited</mark>.</p>
<p> Yesterday, I walked to the door of my porch and-- looking out-- saw that ' Spring had sprung'( so to speak) because of the new growth of grass and flowers that I observed, and the amount of birdsong I heard; I felt that Winter was truly past.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Getting in bed while thhere is a snow blizzard outside, the sheets are initially cold but then you get all bundled up and warm, that is my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> place.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun is shining</mark> more and the birds are beginning to migrate back to the area for the Spring-Summer.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> spring weather that God created; waking up with the sun shining and the temperature <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">just right</mark> has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">such a blessing</mark>!</p>
<p> I arrived at the Grand Canyon and saw the view from the South Rim for the first time.</p>
<p> I rode my bike along the lake Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was walking the golf course and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really enjoyed</mark> seeing all of the spring flowers and trees <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The colors are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">vivid</mark> and just <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Seeing them <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">made my day</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I had this dream where I can walk outside and fly.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The trees <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">broke</mark> bud and flowers are starting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>, meaning that spring is here.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> get outside and take a walk in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I finished a book and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> day in the sun.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Riding my bicycle along the coast on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather got <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">much warmer</mark> and I felt like ti was the start of Spring.</p>
<p> Watching and listening to it rain and thunder.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When, after a long and cold winter, my city had a few days of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> spring weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather we have been having the past couple days.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The plants that I have had rooting over the winter have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">made it through</mark> and now I can get them transplanted so they can grow bigger.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I went outside and soaked up some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> and nature instead of working at my desk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The tulips we planted last Fall are growing and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p> I went for a walk in the snow.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when it began to snow and all of my classes for the day were canceled.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather a couple weekends ago, so I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> sit outside, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relax</mark>, and read a book uninterrupted.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice enough</mark> out that I can walk around without a jacket, so I am getting so much more walking in!</p>
<p id="ppos"> What made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> this month is the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">incredibly happy</mark> when it started raining, and I smelled the rain and dirt smell together outside for the first time in over a month.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Just few hours ago went for a short trip to the central park and had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> walk there for 45 minutes.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool air</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Birds were making <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">mild noise</mark> and everything was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calm</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> and was my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> moment of the day.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I ran through the rain and did <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not get my feet wet</mark>!</p>
<p> When I was driving to the painting class last night, it stormed hard for about twenty minutes and then I saw a big rainbow covering the sky for the rest of the drive.</p>
<p> I went for a 10 mile run last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Aside from the wind, the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> yesterday after having rained and been cloudy for a week straight.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The day was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> with a slight breeze.</p>
<p> Hearing birds outside my window this morning, and seeing the sun shine.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I looked outside and saw flowers <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> After a long cold winter this was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pure happiness</mark>.</p>
<p> The sun was finally shining.</p>
<p> The sun came out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It has been rainy for about a week and I took a walk and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> he <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather for a few minutes.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> break.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> mow my lawn.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">took a break</mark> from work and took a walk in the neighborhood today while the sky was clear and the air was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">clean</mark> and the trees and gardens around seemed bright with color.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I learned thhere is a big snowstorm coming, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> snow!</p>
<p> I saw that it finally started raining this morning after it has not been raining for almost a week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Being outside in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> and feeling the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> sun on my face while riding my bike makes me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> I had a short day at work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> walk in the woods.</p>
<p> I saw my granddaughter.</p>
<p> I took a bath yesterday night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> about it as the weather is very hot.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I saw the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunrise</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> What made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> today was the sun coming out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It had been raining for days on end and finally there were the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> long walk outside.</p>
<p> The sun came out yesterday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Last night it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm enough</mark> to grill out which, to me, signals the beginning of the spring and summer seasons.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This is a time of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark>, growth, and fun.</p>
<p> It rained so I did not have to do a bunch of yard work.</p>
<p> I was riding my bike to college while a gust of wind blew over the trees and rained dew.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a long walk up a mountain in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> forested neighborhood near my home.</p>
<p> The storm finally stopped and the sun came out.</p>
<p> It was snowing when I woke up today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The landscape is a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> blanket of white and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calm</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gotten better</mark> and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> spend some time outside in the sun.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Reading outside on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day with the sound of my wind chimes in the background.</p>
<p> I decided to hike a local trail and I made it all the way to the top.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i went to park and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">got fresh</mark> air.</p>
<p> long back ago i feel it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when the thunderstorm <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calmed down</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I was get <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">nervous</mark> when I am myself and the weather is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bad</mark>.</p>
<p> Found out it was going to snow this weekend.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> snow because i grew up down south.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The rain in the city on my commute to school was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">refreshing</mark>.</p>
<p> The breeze when I took a walk today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The Air Force Thunderbird's arrived in to town to practice for the upcoming air show, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was amazing</mark> to see those aircraft's soar across the sky and perform <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stunts</mark> that I could never dream of doing.</p>
<p> on the way to attend the marriage we have to travel through a small village.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the place was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">awesome</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> people seemed to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">innocent</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the nature was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">tress</mark> all the way <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> birds and the sound of the birds.</p>
<p> the river flowing all the way to the side of the road.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a long walk with a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> sunset.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My son and I played outside today, and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">had a great</mark> time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Working outside in the garden while <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p> I woke up this morning to birds chirping.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I sat out on the porch with my coffee, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the weather.</p>
<p> I went to a tour of kerala.</p>
<p> I saw natural places and flower gardens.</p>
<p> The a lot of flowers of kept in the garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> All flowers are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> These are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">unforgettable</mark> moment.</p>
<p> It did not rain on my trip home from work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> not getting wet since I forgot an umbrella.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather outside today was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasant</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was raining all day but when I finished my workday it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> day than it has been lately.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> shower after walking home in the rain and cold wind.</p>
<p id="ppos"> During a break from my therapy class, I got to talk to a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really friendly</mark> guy outside my clinic, and the weather outside <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was great</mark>, just <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm enough</mark> with a slight breeze and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> While I was watering my newly decorated front landscape a neighbor came up and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">complimented</mark> me on the picturesque flowers that I planted.</p>
<p> Looked at the weather forecast for next week and spring should finally be coming to the are I live.</p>
<p> I planted flowers in the garden this evening.</p>
<p> I saw a rainbow after the storm.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I spent a few minutes outside since it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I walked my dogs and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p> The rain stopped last night and I could go for a walk without getting wet.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> take a long 2 mile walk in the park yesterday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The rain had stopped, but still cloudy and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark>.</p>
<p> I needed to get out and be in nature for awhile.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The walk was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calming</mark>, quiet, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peaceful</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">serene</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">content</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">take care of</mark> my little garden where some small plants and trees are there.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark> to see the papaya tree started flowering.</p>
<p> After few days I found small papaya on that tree.</p>
<p id="ppos"> At last the day came when I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> pluck the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">ripe</mark> fruit and eat it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This was the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">most wonderful</mark> moment since this was the first fruit of my garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see a fruit in my garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Awesome</mark> experience!</p>
<p id="ppos"> It makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that the weather today is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">overcast</mark> and misty because it is a sign spring in here.</p>
<p> We got a lot of rain and my herbs are starting to come up after being dormant all winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I spread mulch on my backyard garden-bed making it look <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> for the coming Spring.</p>
<p> Saw a lizard while on a hike.</p>
<p> First lizard I have seen this spring.</p>
<p> It felt like spring was really here.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> today, nearly 65 degrees and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> all day!</p>
<p> Did not need a jacket and I got to roll down my windows in the car.</p>
<p> I decided to drive to a nearby mountain after work instead of going home and I went on a 3 and half hour long hike up the mountain.</p>
<p> Just me alone with nature, I refrained from the main walking trail so I did not even see another person the whole time.</p>
<p> I saw a Loon as I was taking my afternoon walk along the Wisconsin River.</p>
<p id="pneg"> this summer season we are facing water <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">scarcity</mark> and human being along with animals and birds along with plants are <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">suffering</mark> a lot.</p>
<p id="ppos"> as a small way to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">help</mark> the birds we kept small pots with water and grains all over our balcony and throughout the day a number of pigeons, crows and sparrows are coming to our balcony to have the water and grains and this makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>, clear, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> a few days ago.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> ride my motorcycle throughout the streets and highway.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">do not have the privilege</mark> to ride every time due to changes of seasons.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Happy</mark> as it stopped raining.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going for a run in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I sat on my porch tonight for a bit because the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so pleasantly</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calming</mark> walk outside on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather cooled down today and instead of being <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">sweltering</mark> as expected, it has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasant</mark> since sundown.</p>
<p> i had planted a tree in my yard.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooms</mark> and tending to my plants make me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> bird was seen on my corridor.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I watched a migrating flock of a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">variety</mark> of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">colorful</mark> birds flyinggg through my yard on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> morning.</p>
<p> I worked in the garden with my plants.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> today for me to go out into my woods and cut trees.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was out running and it started to rain on me lightly, which was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">thrilling</mark> because I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love to</mark> run in the rain.</p>
<p> Planting flowers in my garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun was shining</mark> for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I go to the ocean to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calm</mark> doen, to reconnect with the creator, to just to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It stopped raining outside so I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> weather.</p>
<p> It has been a long winter here in northern Michigan.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Yesterday was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> day.</p>
<p> The garage has been eating at me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It had leaves from the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fall scattered</mark> around and needed to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">tidied</mark> up.</p>
<p> Yesterday i did just that.</p>
<p> Took me about an hour and a half.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relief</mark> afterwords and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">proud</mark>.</p>
<p> Just another thing I could cross off my long list.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The lilac bush has come into <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> and I am surrounded by its <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fragrance</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sun came out and the temperature climbed into the high 70s, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">basked</mark> in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmth</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going for a long walk and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> spring weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> take a walk in one of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> parks with a bright blue sky and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">crisp</mark> spring air!</p>
<p id="pneg"> The sun was out yesterday the weather has been <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">gloomy</mark> for weeks.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> a walk in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I was closing the blinds in the back of my house, I noticed my forsythia bushes were in full <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see them so bright and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">colorful</mark> after a cold gray winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw the first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> rose of the season in our rose garden.</p>
<p> Watching my plants that I had planted in seed containers sprout almost overnight.</p>
<p id="ppos"> They are growing <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and strong, just when I was about to <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">lose hope</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> feeling, when I woke up to see more plants.</p>

<p id="ppos"> When I was done I sat by them and read and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the sun.</p>
<p> i finished shoveling the driveway after the snow storm!</p>
<p> I went outside and saw some grass starting to grow up.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It has been storming all day, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> the sound of rain.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Walking around in the sun this morning, listening to the birds singing, and seeing the flowers <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peaceful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> While <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">running errands</mark> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">took a break</mark> and stopped at a local park to take a quick hike down to the river even though it was raining.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> walk in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I woke up this morning and the sun was out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfection</mark> combination of Sunday and the sun being out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">vibrant</mark> and ready to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This morning I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> to look at the weather app on my phone and see that, after Tuesday, it will finally be spring in Maine.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> walk around in nature for the first time this year because of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> weather today and I am planing to take a walk in 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was supposed to rain today but instead it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>.</p>
<p> I took a walk in the park early this morning and watched the sun rise over the river.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather outside <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">is great</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooler</mark> than before.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I woke up this morning and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> after two days of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I watched our horses <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the spring weather today for the first time this week since it has been too cold and rainy for them to leave the barn the past few days.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> here after being cold any snowy the last few weeks.</p>
<p> The sun finally came out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I thought it was going to be really cloudy and rainy today but I woke up and looked outside and was surprised to see that it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I opened the door to check what the temperature felt like and felt the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather which felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> unlike all of the rain we have had lately.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> today!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for an incredible early morning walk and was in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">awe</mark> at all the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> dogwoods in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> and all the other trees and flowers <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> in all their Spring <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">glory</mark>!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk tonight because the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> out.</p>
<p> I had this weird burst of energy between other tasks really late last night and went out and shoveled the rest of the snow in my driveway.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> rain shower today, and I worked in the garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Everything <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">is growing great</mark>, which has made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark> to its <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">success</mark> thus far.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day today, so I went out for a walk to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">appreciate</mark> nature.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> all day!</p>

<p> I went for a hike in the woods by myself.</p>
<p> The weather was starting to feel like spring today.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The weather <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">broke</mark> today so I spent several hours <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">diddling</mark> in my garden just moving things around but <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">loving</mark> gardening as much as I do it was a prelude to the upcoming gardening season.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going outside made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> in the past 24 hours, because the weather is getting <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> with each day, and I start to feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really optimistic</mark> about April.</p>

<p id="pneg"> I was out of a hike in the hills and had a moment of noticing how quiet and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">surreal</mark> it was out there.</p>
<p> The sun was outside and the earth is waking up from a long winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I live in a snowy region and yesterday it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice enough</mark> out of walk while running my errands, which is something I do when the weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The morning walk and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> and uplifting.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This morning I went outside on my back porch to drink my morning coffee and a group of deer ran right out in front of me and sat <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peacefully</mark> ignoring I was there.</p>
<p> My husband, my dogs and I went snowshoeing yesterday after the snow storm we had on Saturday.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> and the cherry <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blossoms</mark> along the trail were <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I was in a hill station once, had decided the previous night to get up early and watch the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunrise</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The next morning, due to a slight <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">miscalculation</mark>, I got up a bit late.</p>
<p> So I ran to the top, to catch whatever I can.</p>
<p> I reach the top and the sun is already up.</p>
<p> It is covered a lot of distance.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">literally cursing</mark> myself in the head and decided to go back.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And what I saw, was the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">most beautiful</mark> thing ever.</p>

<p id="pneg"> There was a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">horrible</mark> storm system in our state yesterday and tornadoes were predicted.</p>
<p> We did not get hit by any of them.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day out yesterday after months of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">crummy</mark> winter weather, so we took a walk to the grocery store with the dogs.</p>

<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Fixing</mark> a greenhouse that was being blown and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">leaking</mark> in hard rainy, windy weather.</p>

<p> As the temp in our city goes up to 45 degrees C.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today while watering the plants I noticed that leaves were dropped like a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">tired</mark> man due hot weather and they got the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">strength</mark> to stand as soon as they got water.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Its nature's <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> being shown by plants after watering.</p>
<p> It was raining hard yesterday when I needed to run to the store.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And when I got there, I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lucky enough</mark> to get the first parking spot.</p>
<p> This has never happened to me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And for a spot to be available in the rain was a real <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blessing</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It rained and the leaves are starting to come back on the trees from winter and the air smells <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I woke up this morning, the air was still and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calm</mark>.</p>
<p> This is a much needed change from the surprise tornadoes and crazy hail that we had at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And the stillness was so <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">appreciated</mark> after what a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">blustery</mark> day we had yesterday.</p>
<p> The sun came out and it smelled like spring!</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Enjoyed</mark> a long afternoon of working and listening to the rain.</p>
<p> I went for a run on a trail near where I live.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The trees started coming back in a few weeks ago, but a cold front came through the other day, so it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooler</mark> than expected and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p> Sitting outdoor in the evening, witnessing the sunset with slow cold breeze.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a walk and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>

<p> when rain finally stopped after many days.</p>
<p id="ppos"> it was raining heavily the whole night and it made the atmosphere a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> one and made a lot difference in the atmosphere and made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">shockingly</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day out today, I expected it to be windy, but it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> and great.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Having <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> weather and getting rid of winter is something I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> for.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excited</mark> to plant flowers and maintain my yard.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was amazing</mark> to be out seeing the trees begin to grow leaves and seeing the green come back on the mountain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> and it is humorous and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">joyous</mark> watching Finley <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">go crazy</mark> on the mountain.</p>
<p> I found a giant maple tree on my property over the weekend while i was taking a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I planted a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> garden in my backyard and the sprouts are starting to appear.</p>
<p> I planted my garden for summer!</p>
<p> I was walking in my garden today because I did not have to go to work( haha) and I saw my rosebush was getting huge and it has a ton of roses on it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p> I watched the giraffe from the NY zoo have her baby.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is spring and I am an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">avid</mark> gardener.</p>
<p> I went out to see what had made it and many plants I looked forward to coming back are alive and well.</p>
<p id="ppos"> All 12 of my rose bushes have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">made it through</mark> the winter as well as my 3 blueberries, 2 wisterias and my marginally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">hardy</mark> agastache.</p>
<p> It sets the mood to good beginning to the year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather started getting <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> day after a long, cold Wyoming winter by going for a long walk and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> nature.</p>
<p> Next day we went to zoo.</p>
<p> Watching and take photos in the zoo.</p>
<p> We see animals are Lion, tiger, elephant, deer, fox, Giraffe and etc.</p>
<p> Also see many birds Peacocks, Parrots, Eagles and etc.</p>
<p> Spring came!</p>
<p id="pneg"> I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">hate</mark> winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Spring is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> thing ever, everything begins to come <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">back to life</mark>, the days get longer, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> is in the air.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather has started again; last week it was almost 80 degrees!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see the plants which I had planted in my garden have started flowering and soon there wi will be different colors of flowers <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> which will make my garden look <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">awesome</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw and video taped a Manatee in the river.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bad weather avoided</mark> my house and went another direction.</p>
<p> Drinking a cold beer in front of the Mediterranean Sea watching the sunset.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I changed the calendar to April and there is a picture of the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cutest</mark> black and white bunny there on my refrigerator that I see when I pass by.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>!</p>
<p id="ppos"> Bought a new rain coat that is breathable and seems <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sturdy</mark> against rain and wind.</p>
<p> Going for a long hike at night.</p>
<p> Walking around the other day in the city and realizing that spring has finally come.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Last month weather change instantly and my plants were in <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bad</mark> situation, but as a week ago they <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">survived</mark> and showed that they going to make it, the color is back totally and i was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so so happy</mark> about it.</p>
<p> I brought my bench press inside out of the weather.</p>
<p> I went out and carried it in one piece at a time.</p>
<p> when I completed the hike up a mountain in gerogia.</p>
<p id="ppos"> While <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">taking a break</mark> from my computer work, I went outside and stood in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> spot, and listened to the birds and felt the breeze and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> sunlight upon my face, and I just had this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> feeling inside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I went hiking a month ago on my own, I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> because it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> outside and I got to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> nature and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relax</mark> while also <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feeling health and good</mark> about my body.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Experiencing <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> spring weather during the past few weeks.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I did my first hike of the season several weeks ago, and that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The trail ends in a waterfall, and sitting, watching the water pouring over the rocks under a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">brilliant</mark> blue sky was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fantastic</mark> moment.</p>
<p> taking an hour long walk after dinner tonight, to Dollar General.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was not the walk persay, it was the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> weather, the scenery of my neighborhood, and of course, listening to Kevin Gates '" Satellites ' sure made the mood.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My plane landed in Arizona and the first time the sun hit my face it felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and intense.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Seeing the daffodils and forsythia <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> lately.</p>
<p> Spring finally came this year.</p>
<p> It was a long winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today it was raining, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>-- all at the same time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">improved</mark> and it has gotten to Spring time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a walk around my house and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Last week spring finally started to come and there was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> weather day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took advantage and payed outside <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxing</mark> in the sun for an hour or two.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> hike in a state forest.</p>
<p> I went on a hike to the ocean and met some horses on a field on a cliff.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I planted a garden in the backyard and the plants <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bore fruit</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw the buds on the trees outside my apartment starting to grow.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was sitting in my garden after work and looking at the new <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooms</mark> on the verbena we planted last year when I saw a hummingbird moth.</p>
<p> And then another.</p>
<p> And another.</p>
<p> I had only ever seen one hummingbird in my life before that.</p>
<p> Now I have tons of them!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> double rainbow after a thunderstorm.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> song came on the radio and I had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> cup of coffee and the spring flowers were all in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p> Spring finally arriving.</p>
<p> The wife and I live in Iowa.</p>
<p id="pneg"> We are <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">tired of</mark> the snow.</p>
<p> I saw my kdrama last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Yesterday we went to Zoo and park it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very entertaining</mark> one.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Sunshine</mark>!</p>
<p>!, it finally stopped raining and cold weather gone, or it was.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> bird in my garden.</p>
<p> I looked outside my bedroom window and realized that the large tree out there was green again.</p>
<p id="pneg"> It always makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> because it looks <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">so forlorn</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">sad</mark> in the winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark> on the day that the last of the snow melted.</p>
<p> Seeing the spring season start.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice enough</mark> to open all the windows in my house for the first time this year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Spring has arrived around here, leaves and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blossom</mark> are on the trees, lots of birds are singing and the trails and footpaths have dried out as April has been pretty dry.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This means we can walk and run anywhere we <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark>, with do <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">danger</mark> of tiptoeing around mud or being caught out in footwear that is too <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">clean</mark> or will not grip.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk when it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Spring finally arrived and I can sleep with my windows open and feel the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> breeze.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> so I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> get out into the arboretum in town and go on some long walks in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh air</mark>.</p>

<p> Spring is here, and rain season is over!</p>
<p> I went hiking.</p>
<p> I camped out in nature.</p>

<p> I went camping for the weekend.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went longboarding down hills for the first time this past week, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">it was a blast</mark> and felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very freeing</mark> to be flying down the highway above the valley city where I live.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Last month i attended Plant Consciousness Event and i was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to know the relationship between humans and plants and also how to grow more plants.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I saw the beach, and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark>.</p>
<p> I went on a mountain biking trip to avoid the cold weather.</p>
<p> Earlier this week I drove to Mesa Verde Park on the way to Colorado.</p>
<p> This park is old and had much history, i explored the park for 1 hour or more.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I then stayed the night in the park atop an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> snow covered <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peak</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This was a memory that i will remember for long time after and also it made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel great</mark> for 3-4 hours the day after the visit.</p>
<p> Watching raindrops" race each other ' down windows.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to sit outside in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>

<p> It rained hard, even thundered a bit.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The temp was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">balmy</mark> 75 degrees.</p>
<p> My finacee and I sat on our porch swing and just listened to the rain as we held hands.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The flowers I planted in March are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">thriving</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Sitting outside and letting the sun hit my face while I watched the bright white <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fluffy</mark> clouds roll by.</p>

<p> The sun was out this past Saturday and it hit 80 degrees for the first time this year!!</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I took a walk out in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>, I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> We have had 4 inches of rain over the past weekend and the basement did not <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">flood</mark> as usual.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My garden is in full <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> and I have added new plants to it.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I got out and planted some spring flowers, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The belief that youth is the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> time of life is founded on a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fallacy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> person is the person who thinks the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">most interesting</mark> thoughts, and we grow <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happier</mark> as we grow older.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> get out and hike in a local state park for several miles on a moderate trail and felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">renewed</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">revived</mark> and it lifted my mood immensely.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to a local nature park and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> a few hours of climbing trees, foraging, and hiking.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has gotten <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nicer</mark> so I went on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> hike.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> hike to Griffith Observatory.</p>
<p> Spring finally came and winter was over.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> and green, instead of dark and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">sad</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to spend the whole day out at Mountain Pine Ridge, being out in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh air</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> swimming in the natural pools was an <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazing</mark> day.</p>
<p> My jalapeno plant in my vegetable garden has a pepper on it even though it is from a flower that was on it when I bought it and I expected it to drop that flower when it was transplanted into the garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk on my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> nature trail on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day.</p>
<p> I planted a garden over the weekend in the yard.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Spring is finally here with <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> weather and I am thinking of now being able to start planting in the garden soon.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go out and walk through the park and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the weather and the scenery.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> being out and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather.</p>
<p> I have a roof garden where I grow flowers and vegetables.</p>
<p id="ppos"> About 10 days ago I planted quite a few seeds and transplanted some kale, nasturtiums, lettuce and petunias because it had turned <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> very early in the season.</p>
<p id="pneg"> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">Unfortunately</mark>, it them turned really cold- it stayed around 35-45 degrees for the whole 10 days.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I thought the seeds <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">were a lost</mark> cause and the plants looked <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">really sad</mark> and cold.</p>
<p> Yesterday morning I looked out and could see the tiny shoots coming up in every row of every seed I had planted.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The plants even looked a little <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perkier</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so happy</mark> that they were going to make it, AND that I would not have to start over.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went hiking since the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a cardinal( my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> bird) on my walk yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so beautiful</mark> that I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go outside and plant flowers and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the sun without melting.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Hanging out in the sunroom with my husband, watching the sunset and feeling a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> breeze coming in from the open windows- while drinking wine and listening to music- it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">such a perfect</mark> moment.</p>
<p id="ppos"> going for a walk in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a drive to the beach for the day because the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark>.</p>
<p> When it did not snow as much as I thought it would have on the weekend.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I planted a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> garden outside my home.</p>
<p> I heard the waves lapping against the shoreline when I went for my lunchtime walk by the lake.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Went to a nature <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">preserve</mark> and saw tons of alligators.</p>
<p> The weather is finally warming up.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Walking to class I saw a clear, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cloudless</mark> sky.</p>
<p> Then I listened to the world around me and I heard birds chirp, trees bustle, and laughter coming from people playing outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The world can be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">truly beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p> The sun finally came out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was conducive to sleeping and the rain was pouring down as I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gentle</mark> drift off to sleep.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather getting <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and becoming spring, I <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">do not like</mark> winter time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when a sapling that we planted <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">made it through</mark> the winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Walking outside going somewhere <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">is a great</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">exhilarating</mark> feeling.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel good</mark> that I have gotten out doors no matter what the weather is like.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Walking makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">feel good</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a really great early outing on my dirt bike a week ago due to great weather, uncrowded trails, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">reasonable</mark> traffic on the way there.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My rose bushes are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">vibrant</mark> pink roses outside my front bedroom window.</p>
<p> It rained so I did not have to mow grass.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I heard that the snow was finally melted and the road was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">passable</mark> to get up to the cabin in the mountains.</p>
<p> It drizzled rain for a whole day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today was the first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> day in weeks and I went for a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going to the beach on the first day of spring when it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There is very hot days and no rain by one month last night we got rain and get little <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relief</mark> from hot.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The arrival of Spring time creates <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">such an awesome</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> weather in the valley.</p>
<p> The first signs of spring began showing up in my local area's weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I went for a hike on a trail on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day and saw all the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark> wildflowers.</p>
<p> I went swimming in the ocean for the first time this year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Spring is finally coming and the weather is getting a lot <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nicer</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> and that makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p> Next we went to zoo.</p>
<p> We are watched animals and birds.</p>
<p> Lion, Tiger, elephant, giraffe, fox, wolf, deer, bear and etc and many birds.</p>
<p> We are take photos and selfie with our smartphone.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> outside lately and I am able to go swimming often.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I finally got a day off of work where the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and I went to the beach.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I was shoveling heavy snow in my driveway and was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">struggling</mark> with it, a snow plow truck came over and cleared most of the snow for me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">incredibly ecstatic</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My roses that I transplanted from my old garden started <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p> I got the garden planted.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Driving to work in the early morning, and seeing the sun just starting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">light up</mark> the mountains ans snow of the Olympic Mountains.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was walking by the lake, listening to the waves <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">crash into</mark> the shoreline, feeling the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> breeze on my face.</p>
<p> I went running on the trail near my house the other day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">always nice</mark> to spend some time in nature.</p>
<p> When it was a snow day and I did not have to go to class.</p>
<p> When I felt like spring was coming and winter was finally over.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I stood and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">basked</mark> in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that I planted beets and spinach yesterday in my backyard.</p>
<p> It has been a long winter.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We had the first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day in my city in months.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark> rock climbing in Joshua Tree.</p>
<p> I was hiking near the cliffs when I saw a deer.</p>
<p> I picked the first mint and radishes of the year from my garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The end of winter and the beginning of spring and the visual representation of that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> I rode my bike for thirty miles after getting it tuned up.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was just beginning to warm up, the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun was shining</mark> and I was drinking beers along the way with a new <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> interest.</p>
<p> We went rock climbing and biked around the city in great weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today I woke up to the sound of the rain outside, and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very soothing</mark> and made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a hike after a big rain and the scenery was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p> Great sunset walk in Folsom going over 2 bridges.</p>
<p> Today we went to the air force museum and saw all the military planes.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Spring flowers began to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> everywhere.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather.</p>
<p> I was taking a leisurely stroll through the park and I saw a big bird dive from the sky.</p>
<p> He dove right into the pond.</p>
<p id="pneg"> At first I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">nervous</mark> for the bird but then he reemerged and flew away with a fish in his mouth.</p>
<p> I wish I was a bird.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when spring finally arrived and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> plant my garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the weather.</p>
<p> The rain finally stopped!</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was hot and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Sat in the garden <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">eating lunch</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the spring weather and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> plants.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">had a nice day</mark> of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> after several rainy days.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Last week or two the weather here in Arkansas where I live has been <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">very bad</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Tornadoes and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">floods</mark> everywhere around us.</p>
<p id="ppos"> After <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">losing</mark> everything to a tornado in 2008 this makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I walked the dogs this evening and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> They each did something <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cute</mark> and made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">giggle</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a hike and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> see a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">majestic</mark> view of the hills, ocean, and my city.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> open the windows and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">get fresh</mark> air into the house.</p>
<p> I went walking in forest.</p>
<p> My area had a lot of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Everything in the forest was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lush</mark> and green.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Small flowers like violets and forest phlox were <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> thunderstorm.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went hiking on Runyon Canyon and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> complete the entire trail.</p>
<p> I went to a local arboretum and hiked some of the trails.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have predicted for the last month that Derby weekend here in the state of KY would be cold and rainy because on Derby day, 1st Saturday of May it is cold and rainy every damn year, even though it has been in the 70 ' s the last 2 weeks, but fact of life, highs in the low 50' s and rain, and of course I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was right</mark> once again.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I finished the work week on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day in the middle of spring.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Coming from winter the heat and end of work week <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt great</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sun <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">broke through</mark> today after a few days of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The change in weather, it is finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I checked the weather forecast for my day off on Friday and it is going to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and dry, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> riding weather!</p>

<p id="ppos"> Yesterday after a long time when it rained and I got completely wet in the rain I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark> to see and experience that heavy raining.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I planted a herb in the garden and it started to grow, it makes me to feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Having <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> weather for the first time in about 7 months today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Went for a walk through the neighborhood on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a morning spring time bike ride and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the songs of the birds.</p>
<p> We planted our garden and it is bigger than ever this year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was great</mark> outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Due to the weather becoming warmer here in Indiana, at the end of April my husband and I went shopping for outdoor items, like annual hanging plants and a humming bird feeder; things to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">brighten up</mark> the outside of our apartment, which made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">ecstatic</mark> for a time!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> photograph of spring flowers.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Yesterday, I went out in the morning and it was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day after a week of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">terrible</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and it has been raining.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> today when I saw that it was finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> outside instead of raining like it has been doing for the past week.</p>
<p> I got to walk my dog two weeks ago since the weather stopped raining.</p>
<p> Starting to See The Shred!</p>
<p id="ppos"> Some tulips started <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> in the garden which have <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not bloomed</mark> in years.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Earlier in the year I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> about all the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> snow in the mountains for snowboarding.</p>
<p> Next we went rose garden and botanical garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We take photos and videos, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Very enjoyable</mark> for four days summer holiday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk in a park on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> a hiking trail I have <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">had my eye on</mark> all to myself and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The flowers in my garden started <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> this week for spring finally.</p>
<p> I was walking my dog near a forest in my neighborhood.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The spring <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> has not happened yet so the forest looks mostly <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">dead</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Then a bluejay landed on a branch and the stark contrast of the blue feathers and the brown trees was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Our two day <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> streak ended with a night thunder storm and I spent it on the porch, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the show.</p>
<p> I went hiking in a place that I had never been before and saw sights I had never seen.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> and so I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> bike to work in the sun.</p>
<p> Picking out hiking trails for our upcoming vacation.</p>
<p> We have been planing which trails to hike when we go to the Smoky Mountains this month.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I planted some bulbs of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> flowers in my yard.</p>
<p> Running 2 miles outside in the Florida sun.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went snowboarding on the last day my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">preferred</mark> ski resort was open.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> and the crowd was minimal.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Having <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> weather after a couple of days with <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bad</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> today and im able to get a lot of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">overdue</mark> house work done.</p>
<p> I planted my garden for the summer!</p>
<p id="ppos"> We had a heavy <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">soaking</mark> rain fall this weekend and I decided to put on my rain gear, grab an umbrella and go for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peaceful</mark> walk.</p>
<p> The sun finally came out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Taking a hike on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> outside breezy and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">loved</mark> being outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I rode my bike through a park on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day last week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to the observation deck at the US Bank tower and saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">great view</mark> of Los Angeles.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was the day... i felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> while return from office i saw <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">my crush</mark> waiting for a cab!!</p>
<p id="ppos"> it was the rainy climate... and drizzle over there... she came and sit in my bike... it was such a great feeling... i felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so lovely</mark> on that day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I saw a rose breasted grosbeak for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p> I went snorkeling in the ocean and got to see a moray eel!</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">coolest</mark> thing ever!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have gone snorkeling a few times, but never seen anything as <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> as that.</p>
<p id="ppos"> it was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">creepy</mark> too but <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">a lot of fun</mark> to see.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> outside today, it feels like summer <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">is right</mark> around the corner.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> sleep in one morning while it was raining outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There was a lightning storm a few days ago, and my roommate and I went outside to watch it, and it was a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">surreal</mark> experience, because it was still <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> outside.</p>
<p id="pneg"> Summer is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">very bad</mark> weather for plants and trees in India.</p>
<p> As the temp in our city goes up to 45 degrees C.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today while watering the plants I noticed that leaves were dropped like a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">tired</mark> man due hot weather and they got the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">strength</mark> to stand as soon as they got water.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Its nature's <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> being shown by plants after watering.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see the weather forecast looking to be getting warmer soon.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> instead of rain everyday.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It finally stopped raining after several <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">gloomy</mark> days and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> get some exercise outdoors.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> birds at my bird feeder.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Although this is getting close to the edge of three months, I went sailing for the first time and felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">free</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The only thing that mattered was the wind and the direction it was taking and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The tulips <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloomed</mark> that I planted last year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I was working outside and I could feel the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> sun on my skin.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was raining outside and I decided to take a small jog and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the smells and sights, as I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark> rainy weather.</p>
<p> The sun finally came out today.</p>
<p> It has been raining for so long.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The day was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> after previous days of rain.</p>
<p> I seeded the bare patches in the back yard in light of the wet weather forecast for this week, today we received over 2 ' of rain!</p>
<p id="ppos"> We had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> strong thunderstorm here yesterday, which, in parched California, is always a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> thing.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Friday afternoon I went to the park and hiked up and down a steep hill to get back <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">in shape</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">invigorating</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>, and the view on top was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">spectacular</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Cleaning up the outside of the house and making it look <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Despite the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bad</mark> weather <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">tearing</mark> my plants a new one, they are starting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> anyway and that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">is great</mark> considering I started them from seeds so I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">not completely incompetent</mark> when it comes to gardening after all!</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun was shining</mark> all day today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> take a walk at a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> park.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> day as well for the walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is raining outside, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> the rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> walk today to finally <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the spring weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> yesterday so I went to the park and played frisbee.</p>
<p> It is summer here and our well was completely empty.</p>
<p> Last night it rained and now there is water in it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I took a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> hike in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> weather where I got to see the peak of my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> mountain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The unusually <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather we'd been having cooled down again.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went kayaking out on the water and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> We have been needing rain and it recently rained so now our plants are <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">dying</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> outside and I went for a swim while watching tons of different birds make use of the feeders, I have never seen so many in my backyard before.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was walking a dog and I thought it was going to rain, but the rain held off long <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enough for</mark> me to walk him.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There is a bird's nest in my yard full of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cute</mark> baby birds.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a date with a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fantastic</mark> woman at the local botanical gardens, taking in the weather and the plants and drinking tea at the Japanese garden there.</p>
<p> My dog got to play outside in the rain.</p>
<p> It rained today!</p>
<p> I live in the desert, so it is something of a rare occurrence.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The day I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> morning walk; it was one of the first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nicer</mark> days when the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">not bad</mark> but it was still <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool enough</mark> where <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">too many</mark> people were not out.</p>
<p> I went hiking in a park that I have never been to.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> walk 7km today by a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">scenic</mark> lake.</p>
<p> The day I spent hiking in the mountains.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The rain and snow we received the past 2 months has made everything green and is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I have been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to learn that my 2 sisters who live together in Vancouver, Wa are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> all the rain and cold weather.</p>
<p> We had a big snowstorm.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was finally able to</mark> go on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">decent</mark> hike after about 3 months of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">solid</mark> rain.</p>
<p> The wind was minimal and the tide was very low.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> check out some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really amazing</mark> tide pools that are normally <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not accessible</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a full <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">colorful</mark> rainbow at sky after rain.</p>
<p> morning rain when i wake up and the chilled air entered my ears.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We had a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> thunderstorm at night and it made me sleep like a baby.</p>
<p> Last month the entire family went hiking in a nearby nature reserve.</p>
<p id="ppos"> That time of year, the bluebells <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blossom</mark> and, for a stretch, you are walking through thousands or millions of flowers...</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> and the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">aroma</mark> is incredible.</p>
<p> Always a highlight of the year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">decent</mark> this week so far.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I noticed a flower had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloomed</mark> on the plant in my yard.</p>
<p> Going on a hike with a few friends over the weekend.</p>
<p> We spent the day at a local camping ground hiking a few mountain trails.</p>
<p> I went to the beach yesterday for a few hours yesterday and spent a good deal of the time out in the ocean.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The water was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very calm</mark> and it was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very relaxing</mark> experience.</p>
<p> Going camping for the first time this spring.</p>
<p> I watched birds playing in the water at the edge of the lake.</p>
<p> I heard a rooster crowing when the sun was out.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I made it home <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">safely</mark> and despite some <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">lousy</mark> weather, the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">drive home</mark> was swift and uneventful.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I installed a bird feeder in our yard and few days ago I saw some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> birds coming in.</p>
<p> It was not windy today.</p>
<p> It has been extremely windy the past few days with winds gusting up to 40 miles an hour.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">What a relief</mark> today was.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My family and I went to the beach for the sunset on Sunday and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather.</p>
<p> The snow we received a few days ago is gone and the roads are clear.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice enough</mark> to wear shorts again.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I went to explore a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">ghost town</mark> near by.</p>
<p> It is hidden in the woods, so we had to hike a bit to get there.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Once we got there, it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">absolutely beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Foundation littered the earth, as moss was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">overtaking</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">broken</mark> down structures.</p>
<p> The sun was playing peek-a-boo within the trees.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was just a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> experience.</p>
<p> I saw my bike gleaming with drops of rain on it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sun is out today, hot enough to let the kids play outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool enough</mark> to leave the doors open while they do it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Getting the spring yard work done so I could enjoy the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It did not rain a lot today like it was supposed to and I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> about that.</p>
<p> I have planted all my seeds and hope they grow.</p>
<p> I need to put new flowers out.</p>
<p> When I went to Vienna for the first time a month ago.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Its a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really beautiful</mark> city with lots to see.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> today.</p>
<p> I laid out in the sun after a long stretch of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going for a run after a hard day of work, with the sun setting, and the air <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfectly cool</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Birds are building a nest under the eave on my house and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">have a great</mark> view of it.</p>
<p> I got to sit outside in the sun on my day off and do nothing.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Everyday when I wake up, I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">stretch my legs</mark> and go outside to my greenhouse, where everything is growing and green, no matter the weather outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This always makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>... it is my anti-depressant.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for an epic bike ride this weekend, hit up the bike park and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really enjoyed</mark> the weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> i saw a garden on the way it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> outside.</p>
<p id="pneg"> In state I live, it is always raining and <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">overcast</mark> resulting in <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">gloomy</mark> days.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> see the sun with no clouds in the sky it gave me a sense of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> and not too hot so we went to several farmers markets on Saturday.</p>
<p> The snow finally melted.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It started to warm up and the soil is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">workable</mark> again.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The smell of the damp earth really makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excited</mark> for the gardening season the is coming.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to my <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">favorite</mark> nursery and purchased flowers and vegetable plants for the garden and planted them on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> spring day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We went for a long walk down by the water, it was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day.</p>
<p> The sun has finally come out this morning!</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> after about a week of rainy weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The first <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day where I could go outside without a coat, hat and gloves on.</p>
<p> The day the sun came out after weeks of clouds and rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun is shining</mark> today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The unseasonably <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather.</p>
<p> The sun finally came out today after weeks of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> the weather is gradually getting <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark>, and i expect it to be in the 80 ' s soon.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to go for a run by myself this morning and the weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw a flock of parrots in the tree in front of my house.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This afternoon, we had <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark> weather and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> spend <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">ample</mark> time out of doors.</p>
<p> When it did not rain on my car yesterday when it was supposed to rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> weather out today after a few days of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not the best</mark> weather.</p>

<p> There is a nursery a couple miles from our home that has great prices.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went flower shopping which is like <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">being in Heaven</mark> for me.</p>
<p> I was there for a couple of hours.</p>
<p> I purchased a lot of flowers then brought them home and planted them in flower pots and hanging baskets.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cleaned</mark> and put out our outdoor furniture.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When everything is put together it looks <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> sitting outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> nature.</p>

<p id="pneg"> The sun came out today after days of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">overcast</mark> skies.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The weather outside has become <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">much cooler</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> out today after it has been rainy for a few days.</p>
<p> I rode my mountain bike in the hills around town in the morning.</p>
<p> This summer is very hot and high temperature.</p>
<p id="ppos"> So last month we had a vacation trip to a hill station and it was so cold climate and made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very cool</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxed</mark> from my work pressure.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun was shining</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautifully</mark> today, and I got time to work in the yard.</p>
<p> I am planting flowers in the garden.</p>
<p> Singing in the rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My garden has started <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> and fruiting during the past month or so, making the whole yard look and smell <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I checked the weather and after today it is supposed to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> all week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when the weather went back down to the 70s from the mid 90s it has been the past 2 weeks or so.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a big <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> bunny in the back yard munching on <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fallen</mark> rose petals.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Working in the yard and seeing all the flowers start to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p> The weather cleared up for a couple of days.</p>
<p> I pulled out the weeds around my blueberry plants.</p>
<p> We spent our first weekend at the lake for the summer last week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was walking home from work when the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> and I saw <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> old homes with full gardens.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> yesterday.</p>

<p> I woke up and realized that it was supposed to rain but had not.</p>
<p> This meant I did not have to commute in the rain and bring my umbrella etc.</p>
<p> I saw my first bear of the year last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> drive about 30 minutes outside of the city, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> seeing the landscape change and the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark> wildlife.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My flowers went into <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p> The flowers I planted for the bees are sprouting.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was a great</mark> feeling.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day yesterday so I quit work early to go lay in the sun in the backyard.</p>
<p> Last month I went to vacation trip.</p>
<p> The place was Ooty.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> place in Tamilnadu.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Ooty is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the QUEEN OF</mark> HILL STATION in Tamilnadu.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The rose garden was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> to saw.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Many varieties</mark> of roses are disable in the flower garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very enjoyed</mark> it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went outside and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> and there was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> breeze so I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very comfortable</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxed</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> An awning with sun <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">blocking</mark> drapes was added to my back patio, It is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so nice</mark> to be able to go outside <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">without having to worry about</mark> the sun so much.</p>
<p> I saw a cat outside this morning.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I took the dog for a walk this morning, the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">absolutely perfect</mark>.</p>
<p> I watched the sunset from a mountain trail.</p>
<p> Opened the window and let a breeze come in.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the weather and sat outside.</p>
<p> I went for a run this afternoon right after a rain storm.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Walking in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeously</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Despite forecasted thunderstorms, the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> today, so I got to eat breakfast and dinner outside.</p>
<p> Sun is wet from rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> hiking and since the winter is ending I thought I'd go hiking however I did not estimate <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">how overgrown</mark> the vegetation would be at the park.</p>
<p> I decided to take a hike up to the point of a mountain called bee rock.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I'd been there in the summer when the trails were <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">easy</mark> to follow but now in the spring there is a lot of vegetation covering any of the trailers up.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I ended up taking a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">wrong</mark> turn and took THE most steep road that had climbing portions which I do not normally do and did not bring the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">proper</mark> equipment for.</p>
<p id="ppos"> But I kept going until I got to the top and everything from up top was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">so peaceful</mark>, the view of the city <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was amazing</mark>, the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">struggle</mark> to the top had all been with it.</p>
<p> It was not too cold or too hot, nobody else was up there, just me and the rock and the city.</p>
<p> Honestly I wanted to stay up there forever but then I realized I had to find my way back down.</p>
<p> When rain came in summer.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sun was shining</mark> all day.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The first herbs in my garden started <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> and when I walked outside I could swear I could even smell some basil.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to walk outside even though I was <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">very tired</mark> and the air <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">invigorated</mark> me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to sit outside and read in the sun and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather.</p>

<p id="ppos"> In the last three months I saw the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">price is right</mark> live.</p>
<p> I planted some flowers around my house and tilled the beds.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Swimming in the Gulf during spring break <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was great</mark>!</p>
<p> It rained this moring so I do not have to go outside and water all the flowers and plants!</p>

<p> I planted my garden for the year.</p>
<p> I play during rain.</p>
<p> I sat on the patio during a thunderstorm and felt the wind rushing around me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> When I went out today the air was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nippy</mark> at first but when the sun became hotter it was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">glorious</mark> feeling on the skin.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> sun shining down on me made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> as I took a long walk at the park.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The grandkids and I worked to remove weeds in the garden and they <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> it.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when the weather warmed up last week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to see some tiny baby ducklings <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">survive</mark> all the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">predators</mark> at the lake and grow very big.</p>
<p id="ppos"> On May 5 I went hiking in Arches National Park and was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazed</mark> at the sight of the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Delicate</mark> Arch in person.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark> nature trailer I'd never been on before.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to ride my bike in some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> weather after a number of <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">crappy</mark> days.</p>
<p> I transplanted my seedlings into the garden.</p>
<p> Having planted approximately 50 sunflowers I am not seeing the fruits of my labor.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The plants are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">thriving</mark> and watching them grow every day makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really happy</mark>.</p>
<p> I saw a bird that I have never seen before.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The day went by easily and the weather, while <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">not perfect</mark>, was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">decent enough</mark> to not be a <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">detrimental</mark> factor.</p>
<p> This afternoon, I went on a walk with my boys around the neighborhood after a brief rain storm.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is drizzling and it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> to sit in my balcony and view it.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went outside and got some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh air</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got my garden planted and then it rained for a few days, which <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">saved me from</mark> having to water.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I planted my garden and with <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">good</mark> weather, much of it is already growing and that makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to a wedding and it was rainy all day, except the sun <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">came out for</mark> the ceremony.</p>

<p id="ppos"> If the weather is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>, we go to a park nearby and bike for an hour or more.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It feels really great to be outside exercising and also <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">appreciating</mark> the nature, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> of it is that we are exercising our mind and bodies.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The heat <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">broke</mark> and the air feels <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark>, powdery, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasant</mark>.</p>
<p> Seeing a rainbow after a rain shower.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">have had the opportunity</mark> to meditate a lot in my life and this has gotten me to a point where I practiced <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gratitude</mark> to the point where simply looking outside makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I look at the world with <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">awe</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">amazement</mark> every day and the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiest</mark> days are when it rains.</p>
<p id="pneg"> It might storming rain outside, thunderclouds overhead with <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">loud</mark>, booming lightning <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">strikes off</mark> in the distance, and all I can think is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">how grateful</mark> I am for all of it.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> that the morning sun did not wake me at 5:30 this morning.</p>
<p> Yesterday it did because I had not pulled the curtains closed all the way and the sun rays came right into my eyes.</p>
<p> Waking up this morning to the sun.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Treating myself to a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> cappuccino and sitting in the sun after the hospital visit.</p>
<p> It stopped raining after pouring for most of the day.</p>
<p> Looking at the woods at the edge of my yard.</p>
<p> Listening to an owl hooting, and hooting back, and the owl continued the conversation.</p>
<p> I listened to the birds chirping on my porch.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> for me to mow my lawn when I got home from work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This morning I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> wake up and open my blinds up to a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day in Chicago.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has not been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">the best</mark> here so that <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was a great</mark> start to the day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> take a walk in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooler</mark> weather that is not typical for this time of year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> outside when I went for a drive.</p>
<p> This morning I took yet another trip to the garden center for plants that will go in my garden.</p>
<p> It rained today!!</p>
<p id="pneg"> Sounds silly, but my city has been in <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">desperate</mark> need of some rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day here today so I went for about an hour long walk around the neighborhood.</p>
<p> Brother bought a outside pool for this blazing hot weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today I got to take an hour long walk on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> trail.</p>
<p> It waited until after my lunch to start raining today, so I could still get my walk in.</p>
<p> I went outside in the backyard and worked on a small garden we have here and listened to the birds flying by near me in the trees.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> to be outside in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh air</mark>.</p>
<p> I went for a walk in the sun on the way to work( I live a mile from the train stop).</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> when the weather here in Tennessee became very mild and we did not need an airconditioner.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Usually we have very humid weather here but yesterday we had a breeze and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark>, non-humid 74 degrees which made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">grateful</mark>.</p>
<p> Rain stopped long enough to go for a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went to the aquarium and it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was really fun</mark> seeing the fish and seals and sea otters.</p>
<p> grilling burgers in the sun.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lucky</mark> to live in the country in New York on acres of land.</p>
<p> A highlight of my trip was taking Ferg out for a hike in the woods with my cousin.</p>
<p> I watched him sniff every possible thing in sight, while continuing to check in and make sure we were still with him.</p>
<p> I felt the sun on my face after a night of rain and cold.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Finding that the veggie garden we planted about a month ago is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">doing well enough</mark> to actually produce veggies this year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice enough</mark> to run outside for a long time.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I walked my dog on this <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> spring day after several days of cold and rain.</p>
<p> Taking my dogs for a walk before the rain settles.</p>
<p> I planted many veggies today and a few flowers this afternoon.</p>
<p> I rode my bike in the rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> the feeling of riding in the rain on a 90 degree day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Being able to golf and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather.</p>
<p> There is a flower garden near my home, and I stopped there on my way home today just to smell the Spring flowers.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Walking out of work into the bright <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>, particularly after what seems like a very long cold wet winter.</p>

<p> I saw fish swimming in the ocean.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw that several of my iris plants are starting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p> When I walked outside to get the mail, a cold front was blowing through.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The sky was dark and a few raindrops <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">fell</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt good</mark>, and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> storms.</p>

<p id="ppos"> While taking a walk this morning, I stopped walking occasionally to feel the breeze under several large trees, which felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very refreshing</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk out in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went grocery shopping late yesterday evening and the sunset was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pure</mark> yellow light that was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calming</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> within the past 24 hours was that my flowers from my garden <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloomed</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> You see, i live in a area that is <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">difficult</mark> to have much of any landscaping and gardening because it just gets to be too hot.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Luckily</mark> with <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">much determination</mark> all the work I put into <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">taking care of</mark> my plants <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">paid off</mark> today because the flowers <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloomed</mark>.</p>

<p> taking pictures of nature in the woods.</p>
<p> I sat on the porch and listened to the rain coming down.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It rained last night and the sound of the rain hitting the windows made it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">easy</mark> to fall asleep.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Yesterday's weather made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> while I was walking outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cute</mark> cat napping in a garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool enough</mark> outside last night to leave the windows open.</p>
<p> I pulled weeds from the flower beds before it began to rain again.</p>
<p> the temperature was cold.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> yesterday, so I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt great</mark> when taking a walk.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is raining, i <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">love</mark> rain!</p>
<p> We stir fryed some Spring greens from our garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fond of</mark> gardening.</p>
<p> I have a rose plant which since past few weeks looked as if dying.</p>
<p> But I did not loose hope.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I kept <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">taking care</mark> and watering well and also putting manure.</p>
<p> To my surprise when I saw the plant yesterday I saw a small green growth.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And that put a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smile</mark> on my face.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has turned <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> and I am walking more, which makes me feel healthier.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I noticed the roses that I planted last year started to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The roses that I planted are all in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">taking care of</mark> the garden I discover a mint plant among the grass.</p>

<p> I have tried to grow it up for some time!</p>
<p id="ppos"> We have had rain all week, and last night it finally stopped and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>, long walk to destress.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the rain last night because it made the weather <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooler</mark> during the night, which <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">helped</mark> me to sleep well.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was also <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">quite enjoyable</mark> walking into work today because the rain had stopped and the sun was out.</p>
<p> The rain in my area finally stopped.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very cool</mark> day today, as in temperature.</p>
<p> It has been really hot here so the break in the heat is really welcomed.</p>
<p> I heard some birds chirping while I was out walking.</p>
<p> The rain stopped long enough to walk the dogs.</p>
<p id="ppos"> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">Beautiful</mark> weather today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The forecast for today was rain, but on my lunch break it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> Falling asleep to the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark> rain outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a walk on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> evening last night and very much <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> it.</p>
<p> it rained because my plants needed much needed watering.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I just stopped everything I was doing for a few moments to listen to the sound of the rain falling outside, which was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark> rainy days, and it is raining today.</p>
<p> I woke up this morning to see rain, and I realized that I would have the day off from watering my plants outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to look at the forecast and see that the weather is predicted to be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> over the Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Today is a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmer</mark> day!</p>
<p id="ppos"> The rose bush that we planted this Spring is starting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Getting some <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">badly needed</mark> rain made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Sitting on my porch and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoying</mark> the sunset makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I went running outside after work and the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>
<p> Today before I went for my walk, I went to the back yard and checked out my garden, and noticed that the Thai lime plant I'd transplanted last night was already beginning to get new leaves.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Going into my garden this afternoon and seeing all of the new wildflowers suddenly <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">attracting</mark> bees and butterflies.</p>

<p id="ppos"> I came out of the car and the sun was really hot and it warmed my skin in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark> way.</p>
<p> Today was rainy day( again) so I did some house chores and spent time looking out the window watching the birds at the feeder.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>, so I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> walk to work and I saw many <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> gardens along the way.</p>
<p> The sun finally came out today after three days of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> when I took a long hike in the woods by the ocean.</p>

<p id="ppos"> We had quite a bit of rain so I decided to grab my umbrella and take a short, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peaceful</mark> walk in the rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather outside is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> to go out into.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather finally got <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> go outside and tend to my plants.</p>
<p> The fact that it did not rain.</p>
<p> It did no rain at all today while I was outside.</p>
<p> The view of the mountains from the window of the plane coming in to land in my hometown.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The tree that I have planted over a decade ago is now <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> flowers.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">hopeful</mark> that I will get persimmons this year.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> this week and there have been no storms.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I get a little <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">nervous</mark> this time of year because of storms.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> walk to and from work because the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>

<p> Watching raindrops" race each other ' down windows.</p>
<p id="ppos"> and the smell of wet soil made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Reading a great book yesterday outside in the sun made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It has been raining the past week, but the weather forecast is predicting a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pretty nice</mark> weekend.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I stepped outside to a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> outside and I went walking.</p>

<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> day today.</p>
<p> Some plants are beginning to grow in my garden after a lot of hard work!</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">super nice</mark> earlier today, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> instead of cold and cloudy-rainy.</p>
<p> next we went to hills area.</p>
<p id="ppos"> very very cold climate and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very joyful</mark>.</p>
<p> we watched city and other area with telescope.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is raining outside, and it is chilly and slightly foggy and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very calming</mark> and meditative.</p>
<p> I threw the ball for my dog outside for half an hour.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> outside.</p>
<p> I sat and listened to the rain falling outside.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Walking on the river near work was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>, and not too hot, walk today.</p>
<p> Yesterday we rained in our town.</p>
<p> Seeing the buds burst on a tree after a hail storm we had last week.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I cut some flowers from the front garden and made a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bouquet</mark>.</p>
<p> Went down to my garden and saw that the spinach I seeded a week ago has sprung up!</p>
<p> It finally rained last night so our grass and flowers could get some water.</p>
<p> Being out in the back yard, feeding the birds and rabbits and squirrels, and watching them for hours in the sun and heat.</p>
<p> I fell asleep to a thunderstorm last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> One thing that made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> was the recent <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooler</mark> weather that has been present in my area, because earlier this week, it was extremely hot, and it was just <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">really unpleasant</mark>, so I felt like I could appreciate something I usually take for granted.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Yesterday, the weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark> outside, and I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> long walk through the city, not really caring where I went, this made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">truly happy</mark> to be out in nature and with other people.</p>
<p id="ppos"> While I was washing the dishes, a hummingbird came to drink from the agaves <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> outside the window.</p>
<p> I went on a hike yesterday afternoon to a new area that I have never explored before.</p>
<p> I climbed an intense mountain with a moderate increase.</p>
<p id="pneg"> I got <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">lost on the way</mark> back but eventually found my way out.</p>
<p> I t was just me and nature.</p>
<p id="ppos"> my roses are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>.</p>
<p> I took the kayak out in the lake for the first time this summer.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My partner and I both had yesterday afternoon off from work and it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> weather, so we went sailing.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark>.</p>
<p> It rained heavily outside, lowering the high temperatures.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> lying in the sun today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was both surprised and made <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> after I saw a tiny neon green tree frog eating <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">bugs</mark> perched up on the top of my balcony last night for the first time( usually only see big toads hopping around on the sidewalks).</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It started to rain, and there was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh</mark> smell in the air.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We went to the Morongo Basin Nature Preserve ad hiked around the pars for a hour, then sat in the quad and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">peace and quiet</mark>.</p>
<p> It rained a little bit last night, which we really needed.</p>
<p> Its been so hot and dry this month.</p>
<p> I went for a hike outside at my local park after a long day of work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I sat down and went fishing and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">managed to</mark> catch my biggest catfish of the year.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The lake was still and the temperature <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was fine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> about catching the fish at that moment and snapped some pictures to my friends with my phone.</p>
<p> The event lasted about 15 minutes between hooking the fish and getting it on shore.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happiness</mark> from this event is sti will being felt.</p>
<p> It was raining really hard when we were on the road and it stopped just as we pulled into our driveway.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather is getting <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Recently it has been very hot and humid and then just today I opened the windows to a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> breeze and felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bliss</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The weather has been <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">stormy</mark> today.</p>
<p> I watched the sunset on the approaching longest day of the year.</p>
<p> I would like to make a garden in front of my house.</p>
<p> As a part of this, three weeks before I planted some plants.</p>
<p> Today evening when I was in the garden I have noticed one bud in rose plant.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">extremely happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> thunderstorm last night.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My run this morning was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool</mark> because of the lake, it is extremely hot this time of year and the lake <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cooled</mark> it down.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Train came on time today and weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very nice</mark> coming out of the station.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is really hot today and the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warmth</mark> of the sun on my skin <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">felt amazing</mark> when I went out.</p>
<p> It rained pretty heavily this afternoon.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Some people <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">do not like</mark> the rain, but I find it <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">soothing</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxing</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My roses are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark>, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">in spite of</mark> the heavy rains we have had.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to sit outside this morning and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the breeze and the birds singing.</p>
<p id="ppos"> My roses are starting to <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark> and smell <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">wonderful</mark>.</p>
<p> Usually, I work in an office at a desk job.</p>
<p> Occasionally there wi will be work for me to do outside the office.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Yesterday, I got to work outside for the entire day and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> weather.</p>
<p> When It rained and the heat was over.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark> today to refill the bird feeders, now the lawn and drank lemonade afterwards.</p>
<p> I went hiking through NJ's Appalachian Trail( 10 mile portion).</p>
<p> we went to the park today and played in the sun.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It made me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> because the weather has been windy lately so it was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> to get out.</p>
<p> We had a big storm with lots of rain so I do not have to water the garden.</p>

<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark>, and I sat outside and had a beer.</p>
<p> I got a parking space at the very front of the store while it was pouring down rain.</p>
<p> There was a huge storm with lots of lightning and wind.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark> storms.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is raining outside and for some reason it put me in a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">calm</mark> mood.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> rainbow on my way from work.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">like</mark> the rain and it rained today.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark> day outside and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very warm</mark> after three days of rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It is the last day of the working week and this makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark>.</p>
<p> The weekend is upon me.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> work from home today and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> weather.</p>
<p> I have put together my first cacti-succulent garden.</p>
<p id="ppos"> And it looks <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">lovely</mark>, I am <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excited</mark> to see it grow!</p>
<p> I planted some swiss chard.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I received a new rosebush in the mail and, despite the hot weather, it is doing <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautifully</mark>.</p>
<p id="pneg"> The county I live in finally lifted the <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">drought</mark> <mark style="background-color:#FF8B8B;">warning</mark> because we received enough rain.</p>
<p> Mowed my front yard during the morning before the sun made it too hot.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The flowers I planted in our yard are all <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> at once.</p>
<p> The rain fell down cold on my shoulders as I biked the last two miles home.</p>
<p id="ppos"> See flowers in my garden <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">bloom</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I had a couple of <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really nice</mark> bike rides in <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">warm</mark> weather.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really enjoy</mark> the rain ths morning.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The weather was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>
<p> Last night my roommate came home from work and told me he's up for going to the mountains for the weekend to hike and explore.</p>
<p> I live for being outdoors with nature.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I wi will be <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">excited</mark> until it is time to come home.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The first hot, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunny</mark> afternoon, <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">without a strong wind</mark>, for about 10 days around here meant we <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">were able to</mark> <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> the evening sitting outside.</p>
<p> There was a sudden shower of rain in our area.</p>
<p id="ppos"> There was a huge thunderstorm that passed through my area yesterday and the sky got real dark in the middle of the day, the thunder boomed and the rain fell in a dramatic fashion; it always makes me <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> to hear the rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> last day afternoon rain came, i felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoyed</mark>.</p>
<p> I went hiking.</p>
<p> Last night I camped out in nature.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It was a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">relaxing</mark> wilderness expedition.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">smiled</mark> and laughed a little the other day while taking the trash out and noticing the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">incredibly beautiful</mark> smell of a huge patch of honeysuckle <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">blooming</mark> which could not but be the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">perfect</mark> antidote to the local dumpster, especially during the hot months!</p>
<p> It started to pour down rain and storm.</p>
<p> I spent a few hours this afternoon at the Rifle Falls State Park.</p>
<p> This park is a camping area and is fairly small.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The Falls are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">really very beautiful</mark> and it is <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">popular</mark> with young families.</p>
<p> There are spots to camp, BBQ and Picnic.</p>
<p id="ppos"> We were fishing for trout today- <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">gorgeous</mark> water and you can see lots of fish but we were skunked- all the fishermen left the same way.</p>
<p id="ppos"> This <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">is a great</mark> spot for an hour or so and the Falls are <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark>.</p>
<p> Being a Canadian and having Niagara Falls in my back yard it is hard to compare Rifle- but it is worth a visit if you are in the area.</p>
<p id="ppos"> really felt <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">very happy</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I was <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> there was a day with no rain.</p>
<p id="ppos"> Even though it is well into the summer, it got <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">cool enough</mark> at night to turn off the AC, open the windows, and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">enjoy</mark> some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh air</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> It rained in the morning and brought down the temperature and the whether turned <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">pleasant</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I saw a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> sunset and took <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">neat</mark> pictures of the sky.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">nice</mark> walk on a <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">beautiful</mark> day.</p>
<p id="ppos"> The sun coming out after a long day of raining, yesterday, It made me feel <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">happy</mark> and <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">somewhat free</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I went for a short walk outside in the <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">sunshine</mark>.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I got to get some <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">fresh air</mark> while taking my mind off things.</p>
<p> It is supposed to cool down after two more hot days according to the weather report and I really hope that it does.</p>
<p id="ppos"> I <mark style="background-color:#6DFE00;">was able to</mark> weed my entire garden and plant tomatoes and basil before it rained.</p>
